ANXE2VV6AQ0GU,B00004SQM7,Chris,"[0, 0]","I wanted a trigger lock for my new Ruger GP-100 revolver. The one that Ruger supplies you with is a large padlock that fits through the cylinder, but you can't close a normal handgun case lid while it's on the revolver. Here in CA, strict gun laws prohibit us to drive with an unlocked firearm. Ruger provides a cheap, hard plastic, form-fitting case with the revolver. As I left the gun shop, there was no way I was going to be able to put this padlock on and keep it in it's case. I figured a trigger lock would be much more suitable for the gun as well as the longevity of the cylinder (not to mention a foam form-fitting case being a must-have). I don't want the off chance of something like the cylinder getting bent during transport. I prefer not to have the lid of any case pushed up against it.When reading other users reviews, I found very few people talking about what guns it did/didn't work on for them. C'mon people! Help some of us out! I looked all over for anyone even saying it worked on a revolver in general. I'm not 100% pleased with the lock, but I'll manage to make it work. I'm here to say that it fits OK on a Ruger GP-100, but it definitely doesn't fit on a Beretta PX4 Storm. On the GP-100, you have to have it at about a 35 degree angle, which the instructions say that's alright, but I'd rather it be at a horizontal position. The grip of the revolver is in the way, but like I said, you can angle it and make it fit. It's still tight and you can't wiggle it around. I have yet to try it on my shotgun, although I prefer my cable lock on something like that.All in all, it'll work for transporting my firearm to the range. Nothing more. It's not a lock to keep a thief away. It's simply so I can abide by the law and be legal about transporting my firearm. That's about all it's good for.

I always recommend putting firearms in a safe or locked gun cabinet (secured to a wall, floor, or both), but these kind of trigger locks added to unloaded firearms are an excellent backup, and keep unauthorized fingers away from triggers.Rim-fire guns, and a lot of vintage center-fire guns are best never dry-fired.

It's not very convenient to mount on my BC jacket (actually it's a pain to mount it where its accessible and yet not in the way).  It also loses air pressure over time so it has to be checked/refilled before every dive session (not every dive but I'd recommend checking it if you haven't for a couple of weeks).

AFNG8O2DXRCUV,B0001NDYOK,Amazon Customer,"[11, 13]","I was looking for kick stands for 3 of the family bikes: 16"", 18"", and 26"". Our 18"" and 26"" bikes have hole or opening in the frame, while 14"" does not. The pictures of all three bikes are uploaded for you to see. So for the 16"" I'll look for a rear mount kick stand.The picture of the parts is also uploaded. There is one hex bolt which I used a 9/16 wrench. Once tightened, the supporting platform for the stand seems very solid on both the 18"" and 26"" bikes. A Philip screwdriver is used to adjust the height. There are 10 holes for adjustments. The 18"" bike can use either the 3rd or 4th hole from the bottom. The 26"" bike uses the top hole, which make it slightly less sturdy on the joint, but still good enough.The kick stand can be a bit tight for kids to kick aside and kick back down. I just used a little bit of WD-40 and that made it real smooth and easy!The price is quite good on this compared to others, and I highly recommend it for bikes under 24"".

The stand is pretty sturdy as it is double layered(because no extension). I would think that a 14"" bike would be the smallest bike size for this stand as the bike is slanted just right with the stand out. With the 26"" bike, the stand was installed with one slot short from the longest. The stand is still good but you would not want to put any weight on it besides the bike itself. Unlike the 14"" bike, the stand is almost fully extended so the stand is a little weak. Another recommendation would be to superglue the rubber protector on the tip of the stand as this will fall off pretty easily. My son almost lost his before I glued it on.

It did install well.  One of the pros I found is that it actually made my bike stand straighter than the OEM did when it was new.  The original one always caused my bike to sag a little too much, and that's probably why it bent---too much strain.  The only small quirk I had about this stand is that it sits too flush with the bike frame when it is the retracted position.  I wasn't able to kick it in the down position when I reached back with my foot, but I easily fixed it by bending the kickstand rod outward a little (don't try this when it is installed, put it in a vice), and now it works fine.

A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B0002INLC4,Michael J. Edelman,"[20, 21]","The NAA holster grip is advertised as an aid to carrying and shooting their mini revolvers, and essentially I think it succeeds on both counts. Not that the minis are difficult to shoot- I find I can easily fire even the magnum version with a two finger grip. Recoil is a non-issue; there's a little bit of muzzle flip, but actual recoil is minimal. Where the grips really help is in cocking the gun, which can be a bit clumsy with the standard bird's-eye grips. With the holster grip, it's very easy to keep a solid grip on the gun while cocking. Where I think theses grips really pay off is in safety. When folded, the grips cover the trigger, making the gun that much safer. Even if you were to accidentally cock the gun on drawing it, you couldn't hit the trigger. The spring clip makes carrying that much more secure, too, and less likely to fall out of your pocket.But they're not perfect. While the grips cover the trigger, they leave the muzzle and cylinder open to gather dust and lint. It's still a good idea to use some sort of pocket holster or pouch for carry. And while it looks like a pocket knife, it's at least three times as thick as the typical large folding knife. The biggest drawback, of course, is the cosmetic one. Once you swap grips it's no longer an attractive miniature; it becomes more of a functional tool. Of course, if you're carrying your mini as an ultimate, last ditch backup, that's not much of a price to pay.",3,Makes your NAA mini safer and easier to shoot- but uglier,1292457600,"12 16, 2010"

It's as loud as the ruger but with out  the kick I would say about medium noise level with slight muzzle rise using the higher velocity raptor pellets which worked fine in the 6 shot rotary clipsYou may purchase extra clips from amazon.  I don't recommend flat  nose pellets or any long skirt pellets which may damage the  magazine mechanism.. The daisy hollow points are a cheaper well suited round that worked properly.I use the raptor  because of the extreme penetration thus I carry this  pistol in my truck  for  protection. since I don't qualify for a firearm. However in Florida  you may carry a handgun loaded in a holster or case or glove box as long as you have to do  at least two movements  or actions to use it . Like open the glove box  and reach in to pull it out.A well placed shot to the neck artery would  be deadly Please be safe, this is not a toy never point this or any gun at another person under any circumstances unless it's a last resort to protect a human life.",5,A really heavy hitter for a pellet pistol  !,1372204800,"06 26, 2013"

This was standard issue about ten years ago before all those funky modern camoflouge colors came out. The cover has 2 flaps that can be snapped shut once you insert your plastic canteen and/or cup, thus keeping everything firmly in place. There is also a small pouch on the outside for the intended purpose of placing your water purifying tabs, salt tabs, matches, or whatever inside. 2 each metal belt loops are provided for attachment to a web belt, back pack, etc. One reviewer stated that he had a hard time un-doing the metal loops from his belt when he wanted to drink some water. Leaves one to wonder why he just did not un-snap the flaps and pull the canteen out of the cover? There is also a small metal framed hole at the bottom of the cover; this is for drainage/evaporation should the cover become wet. Once wet, the cover does dry quite quickly. The cover is made out of some very tough nylon and is quite resistant to tears. When I was in the Army, I had to construct numerous razor wire and barbed wire obstacles while wearing all that army gear. My gear would always get caught up in the wire and the most damage that I ever received on these style canteen covers was some scuff marks/fraying to the material. The nylon material will hold up fantastically for caving, rock climbing, etc. If you have any problems with this canteen cover, it will be most likely with the metal snaps for the flaps. Sometimes they do get a little temperamental. You may experience some minor fraying of the material around the metal snaps, small pouch or the metal framed hole on the bottom. That minor damage will come about depending on the kind of abuse you put this cover through. Price for this item is very good, about the same as you would find in a surplus store. Good value and good tough item. I still use these old army issue items for hiking, camping, biking.",4,Happy Camper/Hiker,1253491200,"09 21, 2009"

A190EMPCHI6SSH,B000A20X1E,Jonathan Brett,"[4, 4]","We did a real world distance test with 7 different whistles. &#34;decibel&#34; tests with meters are NOT representative of real world distance tests with wind, birds, hills, etc.. They are misleading.These are the 7 whistles we tested at 1/4 mile distance, over a hill and with general outdoor noise present (birds, wind, etc.), in order of loudness:1) Storm (or the Fox Sonik Blast - see update below)2) Fox 40 Classic3) Acme Tornado 2000 - the &#34;loudest whistle in the world&#34;4) Acme Tornado5) Cheap tubular aluminum whistle from GoingGear.com6) Fox 40 Sharx - on paper, their loudest whistle in decibels7) Cheap $1.50 whistle\compass\thermometer from DealExtremeFox 40 Micro can be added to the bottom of this list - see update belowI did my test two different ways and then compared the results. First I had my 90 lb. son blow each whistle 3 times while I listened from 1/4 mile away, over a small hill. We could not see each other, but we used walkie talkies to communicate. Then we traded places and repeated the testing. We both wrote down our scores which were based on how loud we perceived each whistle, and we did not show them to each other until all testing was done. Here were the results:We both rated the Storm to be the loudest, easily.We both rated the Fox 40 CLASSIC to be the second loudest.We both rated the Acme Tornado 2000 to be the third loudest.The remaining 4 whistles were not significantly different from one another and none of these 4 were even close to the top 3, with the exception of the Acme Tornado which, to my ears, was rated the fourth loudest. Not surprisingly, both the cheap whistles were barely heard, but VERY surprisingly, the Fox 40 Sharx was no louder. In fact, my son actually rated the cheap aluminum whistle to be just a bit louder than the Sharx. I rated them the same.The biggest surprise was the Fox 40 Sharx, which was among the quietest of the bunch. And here is the irony. Up close, the Sharx was, by far, the most ear-piercing, even more than the Storm. Hence the reason you can't do close up tests for whistles. The pitch of the whistle is just too misleading up close, and they simply do not carry over a distance the way you would think.Conclusion: If you want a real &#34;life saver&#34; from a distance, choose the Storm. If it's too big for your taste, choose the Fox 40 Classic. The Acme 2000 would be a runner-up. Throw the rest away or give them to your little children to play with. At 1/4 mile they are barely heard.Update 4-10-12: I was provoked to purchase, and add the Fox Sonik Blast to this test. Since there was no real need to compare it to all the whistles already tested, we tested it against the top 2 contenders - The Storm & the Fox 40 Classic. We tested using the exact same test. Here is the result: We both rated the Sonik Blast louder than the Fox 40 Classic. I perceived the Storm to be louder (easier to hear at that distance) than the Sonik Blast, while my son perceived the Sonik Blast to be louder. So, perhaps we could call it a tie, as far as which one was heard more easily under our test conditions. Although these two whistles may be about equal in loudness, they have very different tones. The Storm is a lower pitched tone while the Sonic Blast is a higher pitch, which made it more difficult for me to distinguish it from the nearby birds that were chirping. This is likely why the Storm sounded louder to me. Either way, based on this update, I would move the Fox 40 Classic into 3rd place.Given the much smaller size of the Sonik Blast, compared to the Storm, this would  be the whistle of choice for those preferring a smaller size. I will still keep the Storm attached to each of our kayaks as the whistle of choice, because I prefer the larger size for this purpose. For a backpack or pocket, however, I will be using the Sonik Blast. Having said all this, I would like to emphasize that none of these whistles are much of a &#8220;life-saver&#8221;, for the following reason. Although we were able to hear these whistles at our test distance, it was only because we knew they were being blown and we were trying to hear them. Had I not known somebody was blowing these whistles, including the Storm, it is very doubtful I would have ever been able to distinguish the noise from the sounds of nature itself. In other words, whistles are only helpful at fairly close range, unless there is no other noise whatsoever going on, such as wind and birds. Bottom line: A whistle may save a life, but don&#8217;t count on it.Update 4-5-14: We just included the Fox 40 Micro in this test, up against the top 3 (Storm, Fox Sonic Blast, & Fox 40 Classic). It was no comparison. The Micro could barely be heard by either of us. I would put it at the bottom of the list, no better than a cheap $2 whistle.

A2GVM2T7J83D22,B000A6QIMS,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","I only received this rower 3 days ago so this is an initial review.  I'll update it as my experience evolves.PROS1.  It is beautiful.  The wood and construction of the machine are top notch.  You would expect that for the price.2.  The Price is quite steep compared to the cost of monthly gym fees.  Then again I think the convenience is worth its weight in gold.  Coming home from work after a long day I found myself always skipping the gym.  Now I am determined to make it a routine to jump on the machine every day after work for 30 minutes to an hour.3.  The aesthetic sound of the water wooshing is wonderful and naturally soothing as you're working out.  It's also great for apartment owners because it doesn't make much noise which treadmill stomping can.4.  Size.  It is a long machine 82 inches.  I live in a studio condo about 300sq feet.  I have to move my coffee table and slide my couch a little but when I'm done it stands in a small 32&#34; square behind my door.  It's perfect.  I don't have room for a treadmill or anything like that.5.  The workout.  Very low impact and very good at making you drip sweat.  A good 30 minute workout at 25 strokes per minute will get your heart rate up to burn calories.  I'm hoping to trim up after I've gained 20 lbs from an IT desk job.  Keeping good form, and not overdoing it you will find this is a great machine to add to a diet or workout plan.Cons:1.  The computer is a bit poor.  The power button is so soft it frequently gets stuck down so if I want to pause it by pushing it, it gets stuck and resets!  So I have to remember okay I went for 15 minutes now I have to go another 15.  Annoying but not terrible.  There are no preprogrammed exercises but you can set them up manually which I haven't bothered with the computer takes getting used to.  I do feel the concept c2 has a better computer but it's not a big breaking point.  I simply turn it on, begin rowing to start the timer and go for 30 minutes keeping my pace high to burn calories around 700 an hour.2.  The foot holders.  I feel this is true of most rowers.  They go cheap on the foot holders.  These are just plastic pieces that have little notches that lock into a little button underneath and nylon pull straps over the top of your foot.  Now, for $1000+ I would like to see something akin to a snowboard boot strap system.  Something that can support movement at the ankle but keep the foot flat against the rower.  Think.... Straps with teeth in harder plastic that really LOCK you in with a release button on each foot.  It just seems this could be done with some engineering and much improve the foot holder.OVERALLWith these two details acknowledged I do think this is an incredible machine and I would encourage anyone with the will, determination and money, to buy one immediately.  The workout is great it works the core and upper body very well with some leg work as well.  If you don't feel comfortable going into it blindly you can rent one from the waterrower website and then buy it with a percentage of discount based on how long you've rented it.Hope this helps you make your decision.

A3U4FCEAT75XLS,B000A6QIMS,Cynesige,"[0, 0]","We got a WaterRower about a month ago, to replace an old elliptical machine we'd had for 12 years. The elliptical was a good machine, but was taking a toll on my back. We looked at different rowing machines, but settled on the WaterRower, mainly due to the reduced noise and the pleasant swoosh of water while rowing. It's also a great looking machine, probably the nicest looking piece of exercise equipment I've ever seen. Perhaps to an Olympian or serious competitive athlete that would be an unimportant or even silly purchasing criteria, but for normal, everyday people looking to get in shape without turning a large room in their house into a ""gym"", the WaterRower really is an aesthetically pleasing piece of kit.Rowing is quite challenging, in fact more challenging than any other aerobic machine or workout I've tried. For the first week, I could only go about 4 minutes in total each day, with breaks every 40 - 45 seconds (although I could still do 20-30 minutes on the elliptical!). I had gotten very out of shape, and rowing is unforgiving on out-of-shape muscles. It was brutal. It took about two full weeks for me to get broken in on the machine and to be able to do a full kilometer of rowing (roughly 8 minutes), still with a break every minute or two. Now I am able to do 2 kilometers (in about 14 minutes) with just one break in the middle, and I have to say I have really started to like it. Rowing works a lot more muscles and muscle groups than other machines; when you finish a vigorous rowing workout you can feel it from your shoulders to your toes. With each passing day I feel more flexible and stronger, and I am losing weight. It is getting very easy to see how this machine can really deliver the fitness and weight loss results that I seek.The only real criticism I have of the WaterRower is the computer readout gadget. It isn't backlit, and it doesn't have color. It provides the basic information -- strokes per minute, heart rate ($100 extra for that option, ugh), time, distance, and 500 meter pace, the latter being the data point that rowers care most about -- but lacks the kinds of motivational tools, cool graphics, or competitive games that my wife and I are accustomed to seeing on exercise equipment. Supposedly there are third-party apps that you can use with a laptop to make things more interesting, such as rowing against a pace boat, or down scenic rivers and so forth, but NONE of them, as of this date, are for sale and operational. It looks to me like a small third-party market started to take off for WaterRower ten years ago and then kind of folded. The only app I could find which is working just provides basic performance info (pace, time, etc) on a computer or TV screen. Yawn. All that said, I knew when I bought it that the computer aspect is seriously lacking. WaterRower's top competitor, Concept2, has dramatically better computer functionality, apps, Internet community, and all that stuff. We thought about all that when making the purchase, but my wife and I decided that the relative quiet and pleasant, motivating water-swoosh sound was the core of what we wanted, and that we could live without an advanced tech side. Do take note that if you want the heart rate monitor -- and if you are out of shape, older or overweight, this is barely an option; you MUST have one -- it is a $100 added option. So add $100 to your cost projection for this machine.I would sum up the upsides of the WaterRower like this:- Genuinely attractive unit which fits perfectly in a well-furnished, upscale house. It does not turn a room of your house into an ""exercise room"".- As quiet an aerobic machine as anything we've ever used, with an incredibly pleasant swooshy water sound while you're rowing. Honestly the best-sounding piece of exercise equipment I've ever used- Comfortable seat on a supportive dual-rail system- Well-made machine which I think will last many years; the quality is apparent throughout- Well thought-out design enables you to stand it up flush against a wall in less than a minute, to get it out of the way- Compared to other rowing machines, it seems to have a smoother, more linear motion, which may be unrealistic in terms of actually rowing a boat but makes for a much better aerobic workout- Phenomenal workout - this is true of any rower, but it's still worth saying. This thing is a calorie destroyer. A month of rowing has made me much more fit, both cardio wise and in terms of muscle strengthening.- Not a bad price. It's less than half the cost of a good elliptical or treadmill. People complain about the price on the discussion forums, but in truth a k is not a lot of money for a high quality exercise machine. A WaterRower is not competing with some $399 piece of crap from Target. It's competing with $2,500 ellipticals.Overall, I have to say this was an outstanding purchase, and has my wife and me truly motivated to exercise in a way we weren't feeling in the last few years with other machines. I highly recommend checking one of these out if you're looking at rowing machines. This and the Concept2 are recognized by most people on most rowing forums as the two top-of-the-line offerings. The Concept2 wins big on computer readout and functionality, is incredibly well-made and durable, and is kind of the standard choice among serious athletes, Olympian types, commercial gyms, etc. However, it is noisy and has a huge footprint and makes whatever room it's in into the ""gym room"". The WaterRower has a subpar computer, and isn't as popular with serious hard-core athletes, but is probably just as reliable and durable. It has a huge advantage in terms of being quiet, aesthetically pleasing and non-gym-y, and ... well, you just have to hear the water swoosh to understand how pleasant and relaxing it is to row to that sound.PS We thought about spending the extra $500 to get the walnut, but decided to go with the ash and save some money. The ash is very attractive looking. There's really no reason to upgrade the wood from there, unless you've got money to burn and nothing better to do with it. I have also seen a walnut one and it's very nice looking, but just didn't seem $500 better.",5,Liking this machine a lot,1403395200,"06 22, 2014"

The four wheel seat was insanely smooth on the track (particularly compared to my old air rower where the wheels are breaking up into pieces). The handle was the normal width handle. It is not round, so one grips it with thumbs over the top vs. how one grips a round bar handle. The width of the regular width was fine (I did not feel I needed the 17 inch one).I expected a pleasant but still reasonably loud sound of water. Instead the sound was very very very VERY quiet. I can see why everyone who has these babies loves them for their quiet relaxing sound vs the rip rip of air rowers and chains. I did not miss my ripping chain at all.The incredible smooth motion of the paddles in the tank and the seat and the long long reach you can get reaching over the top made it a huge huge improvement over my existing rower.

AEOCEVUWO5B7P,B000A6QIMS,J. Page,"[4, 4]","I purchased the WaterRower natural recently from a local dealer.  I have a really nice Precor Elliptical machine that I've logged thousands of miles on over the past 9 years and I've been getting burned out on it.  I also feel that the elliptical does not give a full body workout and tends to exaggerate calories burned during a workout that it reports.I have used C2 and similar rowers at health clubs (although not regularly) and my number one concern with the C2 was noise.  My workout room is situated next to a future nursery in our home and I like to watch TV while exercising.  My Precor elliptical is already noisy enough that I have to crank TV volume or turn on subtitles of programs.  I was looking to avoid that in my next piece of fitness gear.At my local dealer I tried both the A1 and the Natural models from WaterRower.  I was not particularly impressed with the A1.  Due to the single beam the rower feels less stable and I also observed what felt like a bit of binding as the seat approached the front of the machine.  By comparison the Natural had a very ""natural"" feel to it, was very stable sitting on the floor and the seat glided very smoothly from front to back with no binding or sticking points.I purchased the machine and putting it together was easy, although I found that the fit of the wooden pieces near the footboard was not as good as I would have liked (there were some gaps/overlaps when I was done)... I also had a single badly threaded cap nut that came with mine which fortunately my local dealer replaced without my having to call WaterRower.I've been using the rower now for a couple of weeks and have gradually worked up to doing a brisk 30+ minute daily workout at a rate of about 700 Kcal/hour.  I find that the rower definitely works my body much harder than the elliptical machine, for the first few sessions I was quite sore in the legs, arms, shoulders and abs the following day, which never happens with the elliptical.  On the plus side the rower is just as low impact as the elliptical machine, maybe even lower impact on the feet and knees.The machine is relatively quiet and the noise it does make, as many comment, is quite soothing.  The biggest drawback to rowing is the monotony of it, I try to vary the pace a bit, like sprinting for 5 minutes and then going back to a more normal pace for 10 minutes.  It's also important to keep good form with a rower as throwing your lower back out is a definite possibility if you do it wrong.  I have upper back problems and am hoping that the shoulder and arm work will help to strengthen my neck and upper torso and help a bit with two bad disks in my neck.  Another drawback is that since the rower really is ""total body"" you can't use your hands to get a drink of water, towel off sweat, skip a commercial, etc... without pausing your workout.  This isn't a problem with most other exercise machines so it is worth mentioning.So why do I rate this product 4 stars instead of five?  I do feel that there is room for improvement, especially considering the $1000+ price;1. I find the screen of the computer very difficult to read, especially in low light.  At this day and age they should be using a color LCD or at least make that a paid for upgrade option.... you could charge/operate it by the rowing motion itself.2. The computer keeps counting time even if you momentarily pause rowing, it can let you ""cheat"" on how much time you've really been working out.3. I had some assembly problems with mine, as mentioned in my review.... they were relatively minor but unexpected in a device of this price.4. As many have commented the foot rests are not the best.  I don't like that the strap loops across both of them so if you over tighten one you don't have enough strap for the other foot.  They also are a bit too flexible.  they should have some kind of rubber buckle/cinch that would be more comfortable and secure and also offer the ability to row in bare feet or socks.5. I don't really like the seat all that much.  After 20+ minutes my butt starts to go numb... although it's hard to say if that's directly attributable to the seat or if that's just indicative of rowing in general.The device does do the job I want it to do, it looks sharp, can be stored upright very easily... I also like the immediate ""catch"" of the blades in the water that feels more like actual rowing...  I also love that these are made in the US and will always pay a bit more for a US made product that has good quality like this one.",4,The WaterRower Natural is worth the premium cost over the A1,1394064000,"03 06, 2014"

Be careful removing it from it's backing because it is a gooey sticky mess if you aren't careful. Smoothed it out to remove air bubbles-installation is opposite of removal. Align valve in tube with hole in wheel first-Push tire and tube onto wheel.-Pump with air and go bike!The bike was a Trek about 7 years old, 26"" standard style, not MTB or racing type. We did not need the included tire tools, just an air pump. It comes with a little piece of sand paper, but since I knew about it before I left I brought my own sandpaper so I can use the kit sand paper in a real emergency. Sanding the hole prior to patching seems important to remove any loose grim around the hole too allow proper adhesion. The patches are very gooey and sticky.

If I were going on a back-country fishing trip or doing day-hikes from a remote, hike-in base-camp, I would probably take it.  I have used it for motorcycle camping, though, and it works great for that, being very roomy (3' height, 8'x3'=24sf floor area) and holding me (5'10"" 190 lbs.) and all my luggage/gear without crowding.  (I have the older model, with tent fabric on the ends of the tent instead of mosquito netting, but for some reason it weighs a few ounces less (3 lbs 10 oz.) and packs smaller (only 13"" x 5"") than this current model.  These specs have become my standard for judging the desirability of solo tents--especially the packed length, which is so short as to easily fit inside a smaller backpack, or a motorcycle tailbag.)  It is very dry in the rain (taped seams), but also well ventilated for a single-wall tent, which is confirmed by noting the very small number of complaints of minor condensation in the interior (condensation being one of those things people notice right away when it happens, but never think about or mention when it doesn't...).Its one ""fault"" in the high-tech consumerist outdoors market is that it isn't tech-sexy-angular and garishly colorful and offered as Ultra-anything, like other tents, and I'm always apprehensive that Eureka! may give-in and change or discontinue it, but so far it seems to be selling steadily enough to stay in their product line-up.  It is a GREAT tent, though: well designed and made, easy to pitch and strike, plenty of interior space and headroom, muted coloration, weather proven, well ventilated, easily packable, relatively light, sturdy, reliable--in short, everything any tent should be.Think of it as the Volkswagen Beetle of tents: She may be plain, even old-fashioned, but you can count on her where it matters...",5,"A Great, Under-appreciated Volkswagen Beetle of a Tent!",1274745600,"05 25, 2010"

The aluminum was very light but seemed sturdy enough to do the job. I flopped a 6X8 tarp--folded to 3X8--for a footprint and it was a perfect fit. As there were no problem winds, I didn't use the stakes.I am just under 5'11 193 lbs and there was sitting headroom and floor space for my fairly large duffle and two other bags of food and such. With the screen door and two big windows, the tent is airy, though there wasn't much breeze until about 2:00 a.m. when the rains came.I hopped out and rigged the fly, which went on easily, even in the dark and semi-awake (I had checked this out and rigged the little fly pole in it before bedding down). The rain, which lasted through the next day with only a few hours break, increased to a strong rain, but not extremely heavy winds, maybe 12-15ish.  The tent was unaffected.Though the humidity got me slightly, even with the screens open after the rain--humidity is 100 per cent in this area--the tent itself was bone dry the next morning.I strongly suggest the folded 6X8 tarp as a footprint because you can open it back up and have a clean surface to break down in. For example, my area had become muddy from the rain and I was do the break down on the tarp, keeping the tent clean.  Besides, a 6X8 tarp is handy anyway (it was that rainy weekend, believe me!). The tent came down methodically easily and stowed in the bag easily.Weight: Though this must certainly be considered lightweight, I personally consider it a bit heavy for backpacking (though many surely wouldn't.  Still, my pack tent weighs 25 oz.).  The Back Country's actual weight on my scales is 62.8 oz. (3 lbs, 14.8 oz). I don't hike unless I have to though, so I love this tent for camping.Like my title says, it has it all.",5,"Light, Airy, Roomy, Solid, Easy",1370476800,"06 06, 2013"
A746EJ1ZA5GQQ,B000EQ8VJC,"Shorty L ""Shorty""","[1, 7]","First off, I wouldnt mind going camping with this tent. Having said that, I found one thats better and also a better price. Ordered 3 one-man tents and compared them. The Eureka Backcountry was nice in some ways and lacking in others.Its free standing which is cool because most one-man tents are not, but they achieve that by designing this as a cut down normal dome tent as opposed to a proper one-man tent design. Crawling in the side is a hassle and I'm not tall, only 5'3"". Not a terribly spacious interior even for one person. The high part is in the middle which isnt terribly useful or comfortable. Most solo tents are low by the feet and spacious by the head which is a better overall design. Its constructed well enough for being made in China, but I didnt feel the quality of materials or stitching warrant such a high MSRP. If you find it cheaper here or on sale somewhere else, its a much better bargain for what you get. The included stakes are small and poorly designed. I understand most serious campers make a habit of immediately replacing their stakes but its worth mentioning anyway, particularly as another tent I bought included MUCH better stakes by default. Directions for setup were easy enough but like many modern tents they included some extra pieces and didnt tell you what they are used for. Very annoying. Rain fly attaches easily and does a halfway decent job of covering the tent. Its walls are mostly mesh so not only is the rain fly a necessity, but I dont think its a true 3 season tent. They must be assuming you live in those few parts of the country which have both mild springs and autumns, and also mild summers as well. Otherwise its really more of a 2 or 1 season tent, depending on where you live. I grew up in Minnesota and currently live in Virginia. For MN this would only be a decent summer tent, too thin and flimsy and too much mesh for a mild fall by our standards. In Virginia it would be fine during a normal spring or fall but because of the dark colors it wouldnt be great during a hot summer. You'd need some sort of cooling.There are little sacks on the interior but not in convenient locations, no way to dangle stuff from the high center ceiling. I like the idea of the bowl bottom to keep out water, but would never be brave enough to try it in a flood. Did not have the opportunity to try this in the rain.Overall its a decent enough tent but the difficulty getting in and out, lack of width for rolling around or keeping my gear inside, and mediocre coverage of the rain fly all keep it from being perfect. This may sound nitpicky but as I write this I'm looking at a more perfect solo tent, which I will be keeping and using: The Alps Mountaineering Mystique. So I do have a basis for comparison. Its also a better deal for the money at current Amazon prices.",4,"Decent tent, there are better deals for the money.",1330473600,"02 29, 2012"

AETG43ARLZDZD,B000FEUUF6,"Bleudenim ""Dan Foster""","[18, 19]","We all know that different pellets in different guns yield different accuracy and impact results. That said, having tried many types of 177 pellets with my Benjamin Trail NP (1,200 fps.), I settled on Gamo Rockets (9.6 gr) because of their accuracy & impact for pest control around my home.  Rather than continually adjust for different ammo, I also used these also for target practice; however, paying $7-8/150 pellets was proving to be too expensive.Enter the Crosman Premier Domed 177 pellet. No steel BB tip like the Rocket, but weighing in at 10.5 gr, this puppy has given me consistent accuracy (one and a half inch groupings) and penetration power VERY close to the Rocket into a 1/2"" plywood board at a fraction of the cost: 1,250 Crosman/$28; 1,250 Rockets/$65.With their steeled tip, the Gamo Rockets showed little or no deformation at 30ft into 1/2"" plywood, whereas the Crosman pellets had a spreading pattern in the skirt, just what I want for pest control. The Crosman pellet consistency also makes target shooting the bomb.In short, I strongly recommend the Crosman Premier Domed pellet as a standard, all-around hunting/target ammo that gets the varmint job done while providing inexpensive ammo for target shooting. It has worked well in controlling chipmunks, squirrels, crows & grackles (devil birds, if you ask me).

I am so suprised about the accuracy it's amazing. i was cutting the same hole at 100 yards even though at 100 yards you don't have the magnification to clearly see the rounds on paper ( unless you use spallter targets ). buy the combo and you'll go happy and suprized from the range.",4,ncstar 2-7x32 pistol scope ( LER ),1369699200,"05 28, 2013"

Thanksgiving, not less than two weeks after moving to the boondocks says &#34;What the #%*@ do you mean you ain't got no gun?!?!? You can't live out here without a firearm in the house!!!!! What about vermin and other undesirables???&#34;  LOL So my first gun was &#34;born&#34;. I have since purchased MANY more but have always used my marlin as my go to rifle when on the property. Whether it be unruly woodchuck or coyote trying to get my neighbors chickens its always done right by me.Well the poor stock that came with it was and got even more beat up with a few cracks and plenty of dings. With a quick google search for stocks that fit my rifle the first one that popped up was the ATI Fiberforce Stock. I must say that for the price it is AWESOME!!! Yes, for my model and ALL mag fed models you will need to use a dremel to remove a small piece of the material but if you are semi-adept with a dremel or similar tool then this will prove to be a cake walk. After this everything dropped right into place. I did have a little bit of trouble getting the bolt that holds the trigger group and the reciever together to line up properly in the new stock but that is due to the mag release trigger kind of holding it up. After getting that together it all went together great. Yeah there are some spots that need to be sanded/filed to make smooth and comfortable but other than that no probs. The top of the handguard snaps on and on without issue and stays put.I gave it 4/5 stars due to the amount of tweaking and the fact that the included pistol grip &#34;sticker grips&#34; do not stay for long... On mine, the corners peeled up within two days. And yes.. I followed the directions. Other than those couple of things I am super pleased. For just over $40 you cant ask for more... and it is one of only two stocks offered for the marlin .22 rifles. The other one is a bullpup for $130. Yes I will be buying that as well soon.

This product states in the instructions that it is not made for the marlin 795! To that i say poop on u! So first off once i got the stock and layed it out. First thing i did is line the old stock up with the new one and realized that a large amount of plasitc needs to be cut out for the magwell and mag release. Then i need to plane off half of the plastick 1/2 inch behind the front action screw in the shape and thickness of the trigger guard. I had no dremil. I began to outline the shape with a sieries of small holes with my drill then cut and filed flat and uniform. Planeing off that small area was a nightmare,borrowed a friends dremil for that . A while after that the action/barrel fit in with no problem. Installing the top part of the handguard with a scope on wasa a pima so take it off before hand or wait to fit it. Lastly make sure your trigger is positioned properly so it will fire. You have one shot so trial and error is key i fit my trigger guard multipule times ,stock was tight. This review is only on the marlin 795 other models will install with much less effort. 2nd main problem was with my utg low pro bi-pod...... the stock has a extended swivel stud that provides a loose fit when mounting on utg's swivel stud adaptor. the nut provided will not clear the cross pin to tighten to the stock. i needed washers .. that will need to be milled to match the bolt with the cross bolt. on the factory stock the problem was in reverse with the swivel stud. good luck take your time",3,Install on marlin 795 with utg low pro bipod!,1312243200,"08 02, 2011"

My stock came with A LOT of scuffs on it. You can really notice where they sanded down on some of the edges. I also had to redrill a hole in the stock as it wasnt lined up correctly. Took me 2 minutes but still should be something they could correct at the shop as it seems to be a common complaint. All in all I think its a pretty good purchase for the price.

It sure is to me!! 2) It takes standard enamel spray paint like a champ... and 3)The instructions were very easy to understand and follow. Completely illustrated and if you have a model 60 Marlin, should drop right in... Unfortunately (and now for the negatives) I have a model 795 detatchable magazine feed rifle.... SO, you WILL need either a Dremil tool or (as in my case) access to a nuematic file & cutter to get this to work. A lot of meat will have to be taken around the trigger/magazine area to get this to fit... So take your time and do it slowly with a lot of test fittings.

It's not a deal breaker for me. You can put a rubber band and what have you, but I think that makes it look cheap and cheesy. Besides that, I really like it.

Also, if you plan on putting a bi-pod on this stock, Be warned that the sling adapter/swivel stud kit that comes with the bi-pod (I think that's what it's called), will NOT work (unless you modify it)! The bi-pod adapter swivel stud kit is made to go flush on the stock of the rifle where the sling mount is located. THIS stock has a raised area where the sling mount is.

A17SZSI44O7NMV,B000HOOTO2,S. Caros,"[37, 44]","The item arrived quickly and in good condition.This universal stock really isn't. It is designed for the Marlin 60 and goes on neatly and quickly on that model (10 minutes). However, like many folks, I have a Marlin 795. The stock is advertised ""For proper fit, you may need to remove some material to fit on various models"". This is very true, and the amount you remove will depend on your model. The 795 requires a serious modification of this polymer material.This modification requires a Dremel tool, files, sand paper (fine), and two screwdrivers (flat and Phillips). On any model with a bottom feed magazine a two inch delineated slot must be drilled and Dremelled. However, on the 795 I had to do that, and then extend the trigger assembly base area as the 795 assembly is longer. This was tricky as I had to create a 3/16"" inset to hold the assembly. I used the trigger assembly as a pattern and ended up with a good but not perfect fit having only one shot at it.The instructions that come with the stock do not apply very well to to the 795. In fact on several steps I had to go in reverse order. In my case the front portion of the grip arrived snapped in, and I determined that I needed to remove this before proceeding. Knowing this up front would have saved me some time.So with the extra necessary removal and shaping of the polymer and the adjustments of the installation instructions, I finished the installation in 2 1/2 hours. Quite a difference from the Model 60. Also I permanently gunked up 2 of my Dremel heads with plastic. If you thoroughly enjoy your time at the work bench you will probably not be too challenged by the requied procedures.Once complete, it's pretty nice. There is a small gap under the barrel for the model 60 tube and the the safety button is a little less accessible. There is a noticeable transference of weight forward. I actually like this as the 795 felt too light forward and was a little difficult bringing back on target when shooting in a standing position (without bipod). The weight redistribution helps this.I would rate the stock higher if it didn't take such effort to adapt it. One more side note, this stock does not allow for the same fit in my carry bag. If you have a close fit with the regular stock, you might need to get another bag, so figure that in your purchase factor.SC",3,Marlin 795 requires serious modification,1310774400,"07 16, 2011"

Tactical stuff looks cool and in this case makes the gun easier to shoot.The unit fit snugly on my sons Marlin 60 that I bought him back in 1995 at Walmart. No sanding nor dremel required. Took about 15 minutes to change over because I was careful and deliberate so as to not break any parts nor strip any screws.It's a cheaper feeling plastic than the kind you'll find on Glock or Ruger grips. Kind of rubbery in fact.That's the only reason I gave it four stars.After assembly the Marlin feels like a different rifle.The ATI Stock provides your hand with an excellent angle pistol grip to hold and pull the trigger.The unit is lightweight and if you are really tactical you can attach a couple standard 1"" swivels (not included with ATI Stock) and a one or two point tactical sling so you can carry like the SWAT cops.If you are really ambitious and creative you can purchase accessory rails on ebay for cheap and after drilling a couple holes in the plastic stock locate the rails where you can screw on neat stuff like a folding front grip or a red-dot scope.Follow rail directions carefully and plan your work so everything fits before letting loose with the drill.With the ATI Stock and being it's only a .22 cal there is virtually no recoil and in fact it seemed to shoot quieter with the new stock although that was probably just my imagination. The nice unscratched-undented wood stock that came with the Marlin sits safely in the gun safe and will make the rifle look like new again if we ever decide to sell it or want to go retro.If you own a Marlin 60 you really need to try one of these and for around $50 you can't go wrong because if you don't like it you can resell it on ebay and possibly double your original investment!",4,Four stars for the item quality.

The cutout for the iron sights is too small to have the metal bar that increases the hight on anything but as far forward as possible.

When it arrived, I knew at that very moment that I had indeed bought one big, badass knife. Just like my SOG Tigershark Elite knife and my Cold Steel Trail Master Bowie knife, my Super Bowie knife is suprior in quality, design, ergonomics, edge holding and wear resistance! No wonder its predecessor, the S1 Bowie SOG, was so popular and heavily used during the Vietnam War; it was undoubtedly the very best of the best durng that time, and now woth its biger twin brother, the Super Bowie knife, it entails a whole new generation of being the best of the best, and no doubt in my mind that during war, it will be chosen as the best knife to carry, just like its S1 Bowie ancestor! My SOG Super Bowie knife gets razor sharp, is elegant, but is so massive and brutal, its beautiful looks can surely be mind boggling. One will look at this knife and wonder how such a cute beautiful knife can be so damaging to anyone who is on the other end of it and receives its fury!But the truth is, no one, and I mean No One, ever wants to be on the receiving end of this awesome piece of cold solid steel weaponry! I absolutely love my SOG Super Bowie knife, and with my brand new Custom Made all leather Savage sheath, made by one awesome and great sheath makers of his time, Harry Savage, there is just nothing like how my Super Bowie knife looks when strapped on me belt! It is truly one of a kind! Superior quality knife with a suoperior quality handmade Savage sheath; you just cannot go wrong when you put the two together! Thanks for reading! I just cannot wait for a nice excuse to use it. Maybe some lowlife will try breaking in my home or my car even, and I am lucky enough to catch them.

It was getting to the point of being seriously painful (and therefore, super distracting) as I swam and I found myself stopping every half hour to tug at my suit and rashguard into a better position.After trying all sorts of moisturizers and even inserting thin gauze pads into my suit as a last ditch effort to cut down the irritation, I ordered some Glide to see if it might work. RELIEF. Total relief.I won't say it prevented irritation from the seams of my suit and rashguard completely, because when I get out of the water, there is still redness.

I don't use it on a regular basis, but only when I feel friction in my inner thighs which is caused from my cotton underwear.  I've tried other types of underwear, but none were as comfortable.  I sweat a lot, so my undies get wet and rub a lot which would cause chafing (red and raw inner thighs).  After using BodyGlide I found it would help me run through existing chafing which gave my thighs time to recover.  It also works as a preventative which I'm sure is the intention.  Since I don't chaf on a regular basis there is no need to use it every day; although there is no reason not to.I used to get BodyGlide from my local Running Shop, but Amazon is much more convenient.  I ordered it via Amazon Prime and received it in 2 days.  The shipping box was in perfect condition when it arrived, and the BodyGlide was in its retail clam shell, easy to open, package.

Finally got to reading up forums and someone had mentioned BodyGlide.I have now been using this for almost a month and it has really helped. It's basically a roll-on stick that keeps the area nicely lubricated, preventing the shirt from rubbing that causes chafing. It's not sticky so the shirt doesn't stick. Just needs to be rubbed in gently and it settles in quick. Doesn't trap air so the skin still breathes easy. Doesn't stain clothes, not something I particularly care about for my running shirt but worth noting.I've been doing just under 10 miles three times a week and don't feel a thing!

First off, spend the extra money for good quality synthetic running shorts and shirts.  Here is the catch.  In cold weather you will want to wear tights, gloves, base layers, etc. to keep from freezing to death.  The problem with tights, jackets, heart rate monitors, etc. are going to bind somewhere.  By trial and error, you will eventually realize that you need something to stop the chafing before it starts.My best option is Body Glide.

Assembly was easy and it is small enought to be portable, if required.

Unfortunately, not only is the cap 'child safe,' it is also poorly manufactured, hard to use, and prone to cause fuel leakage.The cap functions much like the insipid pill bottles currently in vogue at your local pharmacies: press down to remove. But with this cap you also have to press down to close, and unless you're extremely careful and use an excessive amount of force to tighten down the cap, you *will* have fuel leakage.One indication that this cap is unsuitable is that its threads do not match the bottle threads. No matter what you do, the cap will screw in [...]-eyed. In fact, there are no threads on the cap, merely four series of four raised ridges - one of most bizarre methods of corking a bottle I've ever seen.So, while the bottle is good quality (i ordered a .4L, a good size for my 123R) and has the ability to store a variety of fuels (even denatured alcohol), the cap is yet another example of the need for tort reform, but ironically may even spur a few lawsuits on its own if a hiker or two explode into balls of flame due to an errant spark hitting a gas-soaked backpack.Fortunately, there are at least four solutions: return the product (which i didn't); use a cap from an older Optimus bottle; use a cap from a Primus bottle; or for me, use a UCO Fuel Faucet cap.

AQW4FM4E8VJ6J,B000N22G16,L. Dyer,"[2, 2]","Now that I know how to use them, Pedro's tire levers have worked well and will not damage the rim or tires. The first time I went to use them on my road bike tires, I snapped the tip off of one of the tire levers. I then realized that the spoon part of the levers, that goes under the tire bead, is much thicker at the base than at the tip (makes getting them under the bead easier). Once you have the tip of the lever under the bead, be sure you use the base to leverage the tire against the rim to pull it off. If the lever is not seated under the tire bead far enough, when you go to take the tire off the rim, the leverage will be on the tip of the lever and will cause the tip to snap off since that is the weakest part.I contacted Pedro's on their Website for a replacement under their lifetime warranty, which was hassle free. They had me email them a claim form with a picture of the broken lever and they promptly sent out a new pair to me. Before the Pedro's tire levers I used aQuik-Stik Tire Changer (colors may vary)which is harder to get under the tire bead and can damage the tire bead when used repeatedly. The spoke clip on the Pedro's lever is a plus as well. Overall I would rather use the Pedro's lever and I save the Quik-Stik for an emergency.",5,Good Tire Levers When Used Properly,1306972800,"06 02, 2011"

I am a middle-aged man who has the discretionary income to buy nice toys, and this extends to my firearms collection. I have a few high-end ARs, and have a number of different optics for each, including an EOTech EXPS3 with G33 magnifier, an Aimpoint CompML3, and a TA31F ACOG. My personal preference is the EOTech EXPS3 with STS magnifier, even over the ACOG, for one overwhelming reason -- EYE RELIEF! The abysmal eye relief of the 4x32 ACOG is, IMHO, its Achilles Heel. I wear glasses, and while I am a righty I have left-eye dominance issues, which is the worst possible combination for this optic. To get the best FOV, you almost need to press your eye against the scope, which leads to random ""kissing"" during heavy fire. The EO/AP sights with ""unlimited"" eye relief are wonderful 90% of the time, until you need to use the magnifier. Even then, the ER of the EOT/G33 combination is hugely superior to the ACOG alone. My left-eye dominance issue prevents me from taking full advantage of the BAC, and as I am not in the military I will never be able to dedicate sufficient time to retrain my brain to overcome it.If I were military and needed a do-it-all, indestructible, BAC-compliant optic I'm sure this ACOG would be the ultimate solution. However, as your average weekend Jason Bourne wannabe, there are better options, regardless of cost -- which was never an issue when I decided to purchase one.Ironically, using a Samsom STS mount, I can mount BOTH my TA31F *and* EOTech EXPS3 and use the ACOG as my magnifier.

A1AALH063P9UB5,B000NJZ9FO,jarrod,"[44, 45]","i have one of these mounted on my stag model 8.  overall, the best optic i have ever used.  the BAC (bindon aiming concept) takes a little getting used to.  basically, it is a ""both eyes open"" shooting concept in which at close distances, you do not notice the magnification of the optic and the reticle is seen on the close range targets.  it does take practice to train you brain and your eye to get used to this but once you have it down, it allows for quick 1x target acquisition.  at close range, with-in 50 yards, the aimpoint comp m3 sight is faster but at distance over 50 yards, the acog cannot be beat.  the optic is callibrated to the 5.56 cartridge and the reticle has bullet drop compensators out to 800 meters.  in order to properly use this feature, you must do a proper 100 meter ""zero"".  once the optic is zero'd in, which does not take much, its pretty close out-of-the-box, it will hold its zero when removed from your rifle and returned to the same mount point.  i actually took the acog off of my rifle, placed it on my brother's bushmaster, and the thing was nearly dead center.  put it back on my rifle and first shot was dead center.  that impressed me.it should be mentioned that if you are accustomed to an aimpoint or eotech, the eye relief of the acog is not as good.  typically, you need to be no farther than 1.5 inches to get the full field of view in the acog, whereas the aimpoints and eotechs have unlimited eye relief.  with the factory mount, it sits low on the flat-top.  i would suggest to get a larue quick-detach acog mount and the 5/8 inch riser to get the optic up to a good shooting level.  i bought the larue RCO mount and with the riser, the acog sits just where it needs to be to clear my rear iron sight and allow me to have proper head and cheek alignment to get the full field-of-view through the optic.  with this pairing, the eye relief is not and has not been an issue for me.finally, the only other deterrant in getting this optic is the cost.  most of these with the dual illumination run about $1100-1200, which is steep, but the optic is top-notch and is, in my opinion, worth the investment if you can afford it.  my shooting buddies argue for the aimpoint because of the price and quality of that optic.  i've shot aimpoint and i love the optic but lets consider the true cost of it.  1: the out-of-the-box cost is $569. 2: the comp m2 and m3 do not come with a mount.  to get a quality mount, you will spend another $120 for a larue or daniel defense product. 3: if you want magnification for shooting past 50 yards, you will have to spend another $500 to get the 3x magnifier.  all together, the cost is pretty close.i am not trying to push for the acog as i have used both aimpoint and eotech and cannot say anything negative about either.  i just want to give my experience with the acog and some real-world input on the eotech, aimpoint, and acog, all of which i have shot extensively.  depending on your requirements and shooting needs, no matter which you go for, you will not be sorry.",5,4x32 ACOG w/green chevron,1342915200,"07 22, 2012"

A2GVVAO242EK1D,B000NJZ9FO,J. W. Mullins,"[17, 25]","The Trijicon ACOG is the tried and tested version of the ACOG TA31 series. The sight uses the inverted 'V' reticle which is fast but allows food precision at range. The ACOG series as a whole are one of the most robust optics I have ever used since I took an ACOG TA01 ACOG to Iraq in 2004.Though I don't recommend it you could probably hammer tent spikes in with them with little actual damage. When it comes to a very rugged fixed magnification optic that has been combat proven the ACOG has little competitions. The ELCAN M145/C79 is an option but suffers from being very heavy and also external windage and elevation adjustments. The British SUSAT does not even compare as can be seen buy the UK forces now issuing ACOGs for use on their L85s in high numbers.The TA31F uses dual illumination in the form of fiber optics and tritium. I've found that very bright light as was common in Iraq would cause the reticle to glow too bright to be used precisely. A fix to this is to cover part of the fiber optic with gaffers or duct tape. I've found with practice the 'Bidon Aiming Concept' to be very easy to use thanks to the bright chevron. That said personally I found it easier to use with a scope cap covered blocking all magnification. This may sounds silly at first but with two eye open aiming the brain will superimpose the red 'dot' over the image the other eye is seeing. This also works with red dot style sights and is one reason ranging binoculars have ranging lines in only one monocular.The ACOG is expensive, almost to its fault. That said due to its high quality and ruggedness you definitely get what you are paying for. Its is by no means 'better' or a replacement for a red dot style optic, it serves a different mission profile.

If you install the front of the bracket flush with the end of the receiver (per the included directions) your forward hole will actually be within about 1-2mm of the chamber. (If you drill into the chamber you'll have just turned your rifle into a paperweight cause it'll explode if you shoot it). So give yourself a bit of space and schooch it back a bit.2.

I've been fabricating and doing mechanic work all my life, and just recently got into guns so I consider myself to have an ample skill level.  Judgeng by the other guys review he probably wasn't lubing the holes when tapped, the tap that is given to ou in the kit is a cheap tap, so you need to lube it well in order not to take the thread cutters off of it.  Second it tells you in the intructions to use a drill press (but I have to say if I didn't have one I probably could have done it).  I had a small problem with the alighment after I drilled and tapped the holes, I just drilled the mount out a little bigger to give me a little slack.  My suggestion is to get a bit the same size as the holes in the mount, and drill a dimple into the riecever with the mount clamped in place.  Then you'll have a nice center point for your hole.

Also after getting it to fit I mixed up some JB weld (amazing stuff) and filled the cavity befor I put it on the final time and tightened it.  That really made the bolt handle solid.  All in all wasn't too bad to do, I wouldn't suggest it to the novice though.  Have fun!!!",5,Easy to install,1299715200,"03 10, 2011"

I will post some pics when I get time, but I have no issues with this at all.-This is an update to my original posting. When I went to boresite the rifle with scope I realized that the scope mount was crooked. Didnt look it to the naked eye, but you could really tell when trying to site the rifle. I figured out a fix to the problem tho, Millet makes adjustable scope rings. Two of those can correct this issue. Extra 25 dollars out of pocket. With the Millett rings, everything works out well enough to fire accurately. Well, I hope it fires accurately, have not been to the range yet.",4,WOW!- Now with a catch,1290816000,"11 27, 2010"

What follows is my opinion of the ATI scope mount.Considering the limited options for scope mounts on a Mosin, I was hoping to give this ATI scope mount a five star review, and it looked like that would be possible at first. But after destroying my Mosin with the bolt handle modification, I must advise against installing the ATI scope mount.If looks was the ultimate goal in installing this thing, a five star review would be in order. If mechanical reliability and performance is the ultimate goal, than the ATI Mosin scope mount is a total failure. The new replacement ATI bolt handle feels and resembles a toy straight out of a crackerjack box. The bolt design simply doesn't work as designed.The one screw hold down on the new bolt handle will not stay tight even with Locktight. One pull on the bolt handle and it practically comes off in your hand. The flawed design doesn't appear until a round is fired. One may get ten rounds through the modified rifle before the bolt handle fails, but I believe ten rounds will be the exception.Any first year, apprentice mechanic could take one look at this thing and see the design is severely flawed. Check out the other reviews. Even the five stars reviews admit that more work will be required than the average person can accomplish in his shop. Nothing short of a welding/machine shop will do. Be careful how you weld. The clearances are tight. Two screws in the bolt handle may work, but again that's not part of the design, and will require some expertise and knowledge and tools only a machinist may have.Drilling the holes in the receiver and bolt was not a problem for me. But that's where the feeling of success ends.  Installing this scope mount is a one shot deal. Cannot backup and start over if something goes wrong. Must cut the bolt handle off and now you have a two piece bolt handle that is useless. After cutting the bolt handle off to accommodate the new ATI handle, and discovering the ATI handle is junk, you are on your own.There are professional welders and machinist who can repair the original Mosin bolt after you destroy it with this ATI modification. However, the repair comes at a hefty price and a very long wait time.Don't waste your time or money on this crackerjack toy. Don't pay attention to this review at your own peril. Don't pay attention to this review and destroy your Mosin. The above happened to me. Now I'm looking for a professional welder/machinist to put my original bolt back together. The possibilities of that are not promising. My almost perfect condition Mosin with sawed off bolt handle may be a piece of scrap metal.",1,ATI Mosin scope mount,1404086400,"06 30, 2014"

You would have to drill half way, and then use a totaly different tap, the ""bottom tap"" to finish your job. So I though about it and stopped, I decided to talk to my gun smith before proceeding.Second I went to mount the bolt handle, and after cutting old one off, I just welded the new one, didn't even try to drill and tap that. I have seen people weld those and it worked out great.So the next day I went to a gun smith and he said that instructions included are wrong.

The tap and drill bits that come with it are nothing special, just cheapies. But this is a one time use thing, so that doesn't much matter. The mount lines up perfectly with the receiver, and if all goes well, it holds tight.Two things that I found could have been better: First, you need a tap drill handle..nothing special, just like $15 at hardware store if you don't have one already. Second, the bolt for the action is held on by one screw. I think they may suggest using locktight, but if you're putting this thing to the test, I'd rather be safe than sorry. in other words, swap out that locktight with some JB Weld, and it's solid as #$%!.

A1WV25LU9QKGDZ,B000P433Y6,alchartreux,"[0, 0]","I live in a major metro city. After some extensive browsing on Amazon.com, looking at various ammo boxes, marine boxes and dry boxes, searching for a durable, water-resistant case, I bought two of these shooter's cases with the intention of using one as a ""bug-out"" box for storing survival kit gear,  and, using the other to store medical/first aid supplies exclusively. I am very happy with my purchase, as the cases have completely met my expectations and are perfect for my needs in this regard. Some product features/attributes that I like:-- Pretty sturdy plastic construction. Some other reviews have criticized the case's plastic as not being thick enough, but, I find that it provides a good balance between sturdiness and light weight, especially for someone who is planning on storing items in the case and who wants to avoid lugging around unnecessary weight in an emergency.-- Solid, comfortable plastic handle. The case handle is well-built and is comfortable to hold in the hand.-- Clasps lock tightly. The two clasps on the case lock tightly and are easy to open and to close.-- Pull-out tray with handle. The case contains a pull-out tray with a handle, which rests on two plastic ledges which are molded onto the interior of the case. The tray's dimensions are 2"" deep, 18.5"" long and 9.5"" wide. I find that the tray is useful to store frequently-used and quickly accessible items such as a flashlight, matches, etc. The tray also helps keep the interior of the case more organized.-- Roomy interior. The case is ridiculously spacious and has plenty of room to store stuff, especially when it comes to first aid kit and/or survival kit gear. Some other users have stated that the case's interior walls taper towards the bottom, but, this is not accurate. The walls are straight; however, there is some slight molding texture on the walls. In my opinion, the molding doesn's significantly reduce the available interior space. Interior dimensions, according to my measurements, are: 8.5"" high, 19"" long, 10"" wide.-- Made in the U.S.A. What more need be said on this score? It's a rarity to find American-made products in this day and age.I am taking off one star because of two attributes which I believe should see improvement - 1) I would prefer that the case hinges be made more robust, and, preferably made out of metal, not plastic; and, 2) The case is not completely sealed around the handle -- there is an inexplicable small opening located where each part of the handle is joined to the case. The opening is big enough that water would seep into the case if it was left outside in a downpour for a prolonged period of time. I know that this case is not billed as ""waterproof"" per se, but, this seems like a design oversight that can and should be easily eliminated, in order to make the case, at a minimum, resistant to water intrusion from exposure to the elements.I hope some of this info was useful.

So of course I freaked out a bit.I put down this gel and in 3 days I saw two dead roaches (right on schedule based on the profile of fipronil).  So it starts to kill pretty quickly because you can lay down a long line where roaches are sure to crawl.  If you have pets then some clever placement can keep this out of the way.  In fact, it could probably be applied like a spackle between the baseboard and the floor.  The applicator tip is only about 1/16th inch wide.  Note that it turns an ugly dark brown color.For my purposes, I don't have pets or kids, I just applied long lines of it right on the floor in the kitchen.  I just wanted a strong initial kill of any adults that won't fit in the traps.  I think this gel is great for initial control (killing adult roaches) and then put out the covered traps for long term control.Some advice, be sure that you put things like bags of flour or sugar in a place where roaches cannot get to it.  Lots of people have those 5 lb bags of sugar or flour or rice (or even dried pasta) and roaches can eat through the paper and bam they have a gigantic source of food.  Try to remove EVERY possible food source so that the roaches will be forced to eat the gel.  Remember that if you can eat it so can a roach (I put everything that could possibly qualify as a food source into the refrigerator, it is airtight, roaches can't get in there).

My main defense was the use of boric acid crystals under the stove and refrigerator. These are places that roaches like to nest, so I was hitting them in their homes. I used this gel in more open spots like the caulking between my counters and the walls.The boric acid worked extremely well. It was easy to tell from all the roach bodies. However, I could see no signs that this gel worked at all. Possibly the roaches could never get past the boric acid and to the gel, but since some seemed to be coming up through the plumbing (where boric acid was not used), I tend to doubt this. So I regard the effectiveness of this gel as mixed as best.Also, please be aware that using this gel will leave you with a brownish residue. Depending on how you use the gel, this residue may be very visible. The gel's instructions indicate that it will be effective for no more than three months, but at the end of that period you will still have an unsightly residue to clean up. You may not welcome this task.As a result of all of this, I can't really recommend this product.

It comes in silver and black and is available at most bike shops for around $20.00.The Velo 8 is a wired unit, so a wire connects the sensor on the front strut to the read-out device that snaps into the cradle that is attached to the handle bars.Some thoughts on the Velo 8 wired odometer...The Pros:1.) small in size... but big enough to easily see the LCD read-outs2.) the eight functions that can be accessed by toggling the central button on the read-out device. They are...a.) speed (in Km/h or MPH)b.) the time spent actually biking (the time stops when the bike stops moving and resumes once movement is detected)c.) average speedd.) maximum speede.) approx. calories burntf.) distance of your present rideg.) total distance of all ridesh.) time (in either 12 or 24 hr clock)3.) the read-out device is snap-in: snap-out, making it easy to put on your bike or remove if your bike is left unattended.4.) easy to reset the values on the device to zero by pressing the button for 2 seconds.The Cons:1.a) instructions are in many different languages, making for compact, small printing and somewhat difficult to read.1.b) instructions for setting up the sensor device on the spoke and the wheel strut can be confusing if your not familiar with these type of devices.2.) calories burnt... this value is basically a function of your speed; go fast downhill without a single pedal you use up an incredible number of calories... work like mad going slowly up a steep incline and you burn very little.Bottom line... calorie consumption is very inaccurate.3.) no specific turn OFF button. Meaning the device is always on, although it goes into 'sleep' mode to conserve batteries when idle.The only way to turn it completely off would be to remove the battery.Conclusion:For the price, a unit that will appeal to a lot of casual bikers.An eight function odometer that takes some care in setting up, but once properly installed is easy to use with its prominent toggle button. Also the ease of snap in: snap out to the handle bar cradle is a real convenience.An OFF-ON button would have been nice for extending battery life.Calorie consumption is very inaccurate.But overall a useful biking gadget...  4 1/2 StarsRay Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com",4,The Velo 8 wired Odometer... lots of features and reasonably priced... 4 1/2 Stars,1344038400,"08 04, 2012"

A231NAA9YQZL32,B000RYWQP6,R. E. McFarlane,"[3, 3]","I just got back from a 3 day camping trip and I must say I love this shower. It looks like a shiny chrome fire extinguisher and it has a quality look and feel to it. I hooked it up to a bulk propane tank instead of using a propane bottle because I had a stove and lantern also hooked up to the same tank using a distribution tree. A full tank of water will easily do two showers or 3 if you are a little frugal with the water. Don't put more water in the tank than you really need or you will just waste time and propane heating it up. Also, I used a cheap solar shower bag to preheat the water and cut down the heating time and propane use. I pumped about 4 gallons of ice cold well water in the solar shower bag in the morning and when we got back from hiking later in the day the water was now lukewarm. I then dumped the warm water into the Zodi and used the Zodi to heat it up to a comfortable temperature. The unit has a built in temperature gauge and an on/off valve that lets you cut the water flow off so you can soap up and then turn it back on for a rinse. After dinner I used the remaining warm water to wash the dishes and I discovered that the Zodi is not only a great shower but it is also an excellent dish washing accessory. I can wash the dishes with a tiny fraction of the water I normally use and even if the water is cold it does a nice job rinsing the dishes. The Zodi also makes a great emergency power outage shower/dish washing accessory for people on a water well like me. I give this unit an easy 5 stars.",5,Great for showers and for washing dishes,1345507200,"08 21, 2012"

A 5-star item when used properly and tweaked just a bit. The first improvement is to put a sink sprayer (squeeze) head onto the hose, that way the tank valve can be left in the open position and the tank can be pressurized/operated by one person with the hose hanging up. ZODI should consider that, but probably doesn't because of lawyers. If you are not an idiot, go for it, you won't get hurt. Next, get a thick plastic cutting board, just a little larger than the canister will do, and place it in the corner of your shower tent. When heating and placing the canister, making sure the ground is level should be your first priority. Once the water hits 100-110, turn it off, place the pump into the canister and lock it down, and use the handle to carry the whole unit into the shower with you. Set it onto your cutting board and you now have one-person total control of water flow and pressure. No need to wear a swimsuit in the shower.",5,The way it is done,1314144000,"08 24, 2011"
A1N6MS7Z7PXP45,B000RYWQP6,Spike,"[0, 0]","Upon receiving the unit, I decided to test at home first.  I used 56 degree well water on a 52 degree day.  I put 2 gallons of water in the tank.  It took 35 minutes to reach the 100 degree mark on the built-in temperature gauge.  Instructions say 8-12 minutes.  That is most certainly under ideal conditions.  Pumping 15 times as the instructions recommend resulted in about a minute of nice water flow shower time.  I believe I can make the factory supplied hose work by attaching to my vehicle rack bar with velco and still have the tank in close proximitry to operate the flow value.  At this point, I don't intent to make modifications as others have suggested.  Obviously, warmer water and warmer temperatures will make a big difference.  I think it's going to be a major improvement over my solar shower on the cloudy days when I really want a shower!Update: The tank takes a long time to dry out in order to pack away.  I suppose you could accelerate the process by trying to get a cloth down into the tank and wiping it out but that's a little tricky.  Also, it's a PAIN to try and pack it back into the pouch.

I only use this for commuting -- not for offroad rock/dirt protection -- so keep that in mind.Overall, this fender is great quality, and is very versatile. The quick-release clamp actually fits over the seat tube on my '05 Dakar FS. I mention this only because it is designed to fit on the seat post, but the mechanism can be ""unscrewed"" to fit a lager diameter. The main (black) plastic is rigid, but the tip (gray part) is soft/flexible. This is great for when you -- or someone else -- accidentally bumps into it. The design allows you to set not only the height, but the slope as well.The vertical adjustments lock down with Allen head screws, which is where my *minor* issue comes into play. Even fully screwed-in, the fender can be moved up and down -and- side to side fairly easily. Perhaps this is engineered to keep the rigid nylon pieces from snapping?Although somewhat irrelevant to this item, I *did* encounter an issue with the M1. It broke at the mount on the first day I had it.

The thickness is only 1.75-2mm in this area.  I'm not sure of the type of plastic they're using (I'm guessing HDPE), but my experience here says this isn't enough material for this kind of plastic.

If you don't break it, it works great for a 2.5 inch rear tire. It is fully adjustable, and the clamp has a ""groove"" so that you can run your seat post security cable through it. The bad part is that topeak uses a very brittle plastic with many of their products, and when it gets cold out they break incredibly easily. I, like many other people, barely brushed my pant leg against it when getting on my bike(so little I didn't even feel it pull on my pant leg) and it snapped off at the arm (It was around 20 degrees Fahrenheit). My girlfriend had this one as well, and for the same reason doesn't own it anymore (It was 40 degrees Fahrenheit out). I have contacted customer support for another item with a broken plastic part and they are good about sending you a new one, but what good is it if it will just break on you again?

They are very high quality and seem to be holding up perfectly (I use them in the Everlast Pro Style Training Gloves 8oz). The Velcro at the bottom can be pulled tight to easily ensure that the wrist stays in the proper position, and as long as you Velcro them straight you do not have an issue with the Velcro rubbing your wrist/arm. If you do not do it straight you will feel the edge rub your skin, but if you make sure it is straight it is a perfect fit and offers great support for your wrist, knuckles and hand in general.I am very happy with these!

ACY9QYNDFLVBI,B0013CTLDQ,G. Farnsworth,"[4, 4]","This chain is the answer to my longstanding problem with bike maintenance.  There are several reasons to lube a drivechain:1. To reduce the friction that bare metal would have2. To quiet everything down3. To prevent wear4. To prevent rustThe problem is that basically any type of lube that prevents rust also accumulates dust/grit and wears the chain, adds noise, and increases friction.  As well as getting you dirty.  Frankly, it seems to me that after a while pretty much any lube is worse than no lube at all.  I've tried a ton of lubes trying to find a solution but there really isn't one.  Most recently I was using white lightning ""clean ride.""  It's clean-ish but not CLEAN.  It does have some kind of oily residue that accumulates dirt right where you don't want it---in the friction points---and starts making noise.The only really great lube out there is parafin wax.  The straight stuff.  As in, melt it on the stove and dip your chain in it.  It is the best lube at the first three objectives and genuinely does not attract dirt...at all. The only problem is that it does squat for rust protection.  I live in central PA and it rains here all the time.  This is my every-day commuting bike and is constantly out in the elements.  Chains are always rusting out on me.  Lubes wash away, mud gets in there.  Bad situation.Anyway, this chain has been used and rained on with only parafin wax on it for three months now and doesn't show any rust whatsoever.  And because I've been using straight wax it's not getting dirty either.  I will never to back to using any ""lube"" besides pure wax.People say this chain will eventually rust or that the coating comes off.  That's not my experience so far.  Maybe I'll check back next spring and let you know (I ride all winter long).This is basically the perfect chain for me.  The coating isn't as attractive as I'd like...it's not very smooth or machined-looking.  On the other hand it's always clean and rust free, just like when I first installed it.  So that kind of makes up for it.This chain comes with its own easy-install link.  Very nice touch.  It's super easy to put on and take off.I will continue to purchase this model from now on.  Thanks a lot KMC!============ Edit January 2014 ===========================I guess three months wasn't long enough to evaluate it.  After about 6 months, the rust-proof coating on the interior portions of the chain--the parts that rub together--wore through and rusted in the wet and salty winter months.  Aesthetically the chain still looks great, but the place it rusted is very problematic.  After Christmas break I went riding and several links were rusted enough that they didn't flex easily and the chain kept skipping.  I guess my idea of using paraffin wax instead of a lube with rust-proofing capability only worked for so long.So I ended up removing all the wax, cleaning the chain really well, and then lubing it with a very small amount of heavy oil (white lightning wet ride).  Since I only care about the internal parts now, I cleaned all the oil off the outside of the chain very thoroughly.  All the links move now so the chain is working fine.  Hopefully it won't get dirty as quickly as it used do when I coated the outside with oil as well.I took off one star because I now realize this chain is not the ultimate answer.  I guess maybe I should think about forking out the money for a stainless chain.  In the mean time, when this chain wears out I will get another one just like it.  I can deal with lubing the interior surfaces of the chain as long as the outside doesn't rust.

A3CJ7EHUS0G8IH,B00165P53K,Maryland Customer,"[18, 19]","First of all to be clear, this is a set of two IDENTICAL cone wrenches.  As another reviewer pointed out, each wrench is gapped for 15/13 mm on one end, and 16/14 mm on the other end.The advantage of this design is its flexibility: a 2-wrench set replaces 8 single-end wrenches or 4 double-end cone wrenches.The disadvantage of this design, as discussed by another reviewer, is that only half of the wrench end makes contact with the cone, meaning the torque you can apply is limited.  E.g., you have to be careful and pay attention to what you are doing rather than simply torque as hard as you can.  But this is true of all multi-purpose tools:  they rarely work as well as the individual tools, but they get the job done, take up a lot less space and (usually) save a significant amount of money (meaning initial investment) compared to buying individual tools.So if you are just starting out in bike maintenance and do not want to spend a lot of money until you figure out whether you will actually commit the time to do your own bike maintenance, this is a good cheap way in.  If do commit, you will likely eventually buy better single-end cone wrenches for an average of $10 each (e.g. Park or Pedro brand).  But in the mean time, these will help you get some basic bike maintenance done for a very reasonable price.And yes, you will need a 17/18mm cone wrench as well.Last thing:  these are CONE wrenches, not normal wrenches.  E.g., they are very thin to get into narrow spaces, to apply limited amount of torque to a cone on a hub (hence the name).  Most cone wrenches are NOT strong enough to apply heavy torque to something with a wide surface (e.g. a pedal, outer hub nut, etc).

With this design flaw, there does not exist sufficient surface area in the 15mm and 16mm mouths of the wrench, thus allowing for significant slippage under load.  If I would have been made aware of the design of these wrenches, I wouldn't have made the purchase in the first place.

Theoretically they should be all that is needed for the home mechanic.Unfortunately the cheaper steel used in these wrenches are just not up to the task of surviving the stresses encountered when being used on the outer/larger sizes.  The jaws flex too much and the wrench will strip and perhaps damage the wrench flats on the bearing cones in the process. The inner sizes on these wrenches work OK but the outer/larger sizes just do not work very well.  If the cones are very tight or stuck with age they will never get the parts apart and will self-destruct trying.  Bearing cones SHOULD NOT need to be so tight in theory but in practice many bicycles have these parts WAY too tight.  These wrenches are just not up to repeated use even if they aren't too tight and will wear out very quickly.I would advise against getting these wrenches and instead suggest spending the money on the Park DCW cone wrenches.  You can get away with just 3 of them to cover wrenching on most bicycles.  You should have the 13/14, the 14/15, and the 13/15 sizes to cover just about anything.  These 3 wrenches will give you any combination needed except for the 16/17 sizes which are not as common.  If you have all 4 you can take on any bicycle cone set as I have never encountered a wheel that had more than one 16mm or 17mm wrench at a time although I suppose it is possible they are pretty rare even having one of those sizes as it is.Pros:*Has every size cone wrench x 2 so you should theoretically be able to work on any wheel.*VERY Low cost for what is essentially 8 different wrenches covering each of the 4 common cone sizes TWICE.  If it weren't for the VERY low cost these would have gotten a 2 or even a 1 star as they kind of suck other than for an almost disposable usage cycle.  This whole 2-wrench quad-sided set doesn't cost much more than ONE of the good double-sided cone wrenches by other manufactures.  Avenir usually makes decent mid-ranged low-cost stuff.  This is low cost but not quite mid-ranged in quality.Cons:*Marginal/poor metallurgy that isn't up to the job of the double-stacked wrench design.  It's OK for the inner wrench but the metal is just too soft for the outer/larger sizes.  One or two uses and this wrench is already getting worn out.  Quite Disposable.

Second problem is that it only has a power button and I wish it was a Key Switch so no one can easily steal it. But after talking to the Currie Rep., he said to unplug the battery and wrap a cable lock on the deck covering the battery. Genius! Or you can spend to pay for a shop to install a key switch. Otherwise, I LOVE IT! It's got speed and I have fun. I save gas money and everyone I pass by looks at me with envy.

I purchased this to store in the baggage compartment of a Cessna 172 and it fits just fine. Sometimes, at an airport, it's a long walk to get something to eat, or get other transportation. For me, this scooter now eliminates an unnecessary walk. I would have given this a 5 star rating, but the one brake on this scooter doesn't stop you very quickly, even on a flat surface.

The Elite is nearly 8mph faster,it has full suspension with shocks front and rear and a great seat.

However, as soon as I opened the box a strong burnt metal or wire like smell came from the product, no obvious burnt areas on the outside parts of the product. I then assembled it and went for a test drive for about one and a half miles. A loud whining sound came from the motor and the brakes squeaked. I called Currie Technologies and described the above. The rep told me that these smells and sounds are not normal for this product.I returned the product and asked for a replacement. Hopefully the replacement will work better.This is an addition to my above review. I have to give credit to Amazon Customer Service for the prompt and timely shipping of the replacement. The replacement was delivered in 2 business days including the day I requested it, basically the next day. Kudos for Amazon my favorite shopping mall. The price on this item had come down about $22.00 since I ordered it and Amazon credited me for this difference. Again kudos for Amazon.The replacement product itself passed my test and I am keeping it. I understand that because the scooter moves by a chain drive there will be a small amount of noise which is reasonable. The brakes no longer squeaks. The battery is good.I took a 4 miles test drive and the battery gauge registered half empty at the end of my test drive. On a small hill near the end of my test drive, when I accelerated, the gauge would register low but again went to half empty on deceleration. I already have good feedback from neighbors who saw me riding this scooter.The next day I did another 4 miles test drive without first charging the battery. I wanted to know how many miles a fully charged battery can go and sure enough I was able to return home as my odometer read 8.3 miles. I may have been able to complete 9 perhaps even 10 miles but the battery gauge was at times registering low at 9 miles per hour speed. I am satisfied with the 8 miles range.

I can tell you it's a good quality scooter.  the only down side is the weight factor. it can take up to 240 pounds, but i would not recommend it over maybe like 210 pounds. the main reason is that although this is basicilly a swhinn scooter the bike seat is cheap and for me broke in less than 3 days. so i got another seat (a shwinn seat actually) w/springs and it works fine me, im pushing 240 myself, so this may not apply to all riders. also the heavier the person the slower the acceleration and top speed.Other things about it- easy to assamble, most areas you live in you don't have to have a license, but the cops will get on you if you don't have at least some kind of helmet on, most people choose a bike helmet (mine justs so happens to be a schwin helmet), you may even get ticketed or cited for not having a helmet on. but the cops where i live so far have left me alone as far as the scooter goes.oh, and a bike lock of course!",5,Excellent Value @ $250.00!!,1343347200,"07 27, 2012"
A1D33H7DDMOJM9,B0017KV6ZU,Adam Edmondson,"[3, 3]","Based on other reviews across the net about this little mod, I figured it was exactly what I needed.  I'm not a fan of hanging nylon belt loops on knife sheaths, and this handy device replaces that AND gives your BK2 more ways to be attached to you or your gear.There are no instructions with the Tek-Lok, however it doesn't take much Googling to find various ways to install it on your sheath.  The toughest part of putting it on my BK2 was the removal of the 3 rivets that hold the nylon belt loop to the Kydex sheath that comes with the knife.  By using a small sharp wire cutter, you just carefully nibble at each of the 3 rivets until you can pop them out.  Took me about 10 minutes total, then it was on to the rest of the install.To install the Tek-Lok to the BK2 sheath, you need to remove the 4 screws of the belt loop holder from the rest of the sheath.  A phillips screwdriver will do that easily.  Now, figure out which position you want to install the Tek-Lok (keeping in mind if you want it to be installed for left or right handed pull of the knife out of the sheath).  I wanted my knife to install scout-style (horizontal instead of vertical) and I used the middle row of holes on the Tek-Lok.  Using the hardware provided with the Tek-Lok, insert the threaded grommets into the Tek-Lok from the inside (clasp open) and then line up the grommets with your BK2 belt loop holder and use the included screws to tighten.  You will not need the 3 rubber grommets that come with the Tek-Lok.  I actually used one of the grommets to push against the backside of the threaded metal grommets to give me some traction when tightening the screws.  Now that you're done with this part, just re-install the BK2's belt loop holder piece back to the BK2 sheath and you're ready.  Tip:  throw a little drop of Loc-Tite on the threads of the screws on the Tek-Lok so it doesn't come loose (Loc-Tite is not included with this product, you'll have to get it from your local hardware store).The Tek-Lok also comes with 2 snap-in belt loop sizing spacers.  These snap into various positions inside the Tek-Lok so you can use this device with various sizes of belts and straps without it feeling loose.  Take both of the spacers out and you can fit the Tek-Lok on up to a 2&#34; webbed belt or smaller padded backpack strap.  Or, put the spacers in and this will fit your knife snugly on even the thinnest uniform belt.One last feature to mention is the additional clasp lock that keeps the Tek-Lok closed and prevents it from accidentally getting opened up if bumped.  The two release latches on the side of the clasp are very strong and they should stay in place, but the rotating clasp lock ensures that these two latches cannot be pressed in and come unlatched.  Very nice little feature.  Just use your thumb to roll it out of the way and you can quickly undo your Tek-Lock clasps and remove it.I use the Tek-Lok in the scout-style position to attach my BK2 to my belt or to my shoulder straps of my various backpacks and bail-out bags.  Now it's right up on my chest and ready to pull down in a split second.  This position also makes it great on my belt so the knife doesn't hang vertical and get in my way if I have to squat down or sit.  The composite material that the Tek-Lok is made out of is extremely strong and I can't imagine breaking it unless I fall off a cliff while wearing it, or smash it with a hammer.Best mod ever for your Becker BK2 and worth every penny.",5,Best mod for your Ka-Bar BK2,1365638400,"04 11, 2013"

Stanley has a reputation for ruggedness and high-quality, and this Stanley Outdoor Lunchbox cooler lives-up to that reputation. First of all this combo comes with one of Stanley's famous vacuum flask thermoses. Vacuum flask technology is the best technology for preventing thermal attrition (keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold). I enjoy my coffee very hot and my water ice cold. When I received this I tested it and found that it kept my coffee nice and hot (not lukewarm) for over 2 days! As for cold, it had ice in my ice water in it after almost 3 days (and I live in the south where it's warm).The entire bottle is stainless steel. It is double-walled, with a vacuum between the steel walls. The screw-on stopper seals very nicely and is made of a very strong plastic, it seems very solid. The cup fits well and is solid plastic with chrome on the outside.The cooler has two compartments inside:The larger compartment is 7-1/8 in. x 7-7/8 in. (inside dimensions)and the smaller compartment is 7-1/8 in. x 4-1/4 in. (inside dimensions)The cooler works very well (amazingly well, actually) keeping food nice and cool - I also add one of those plastic ice packs to keep it cold things really cold and at the end of the day the ice pack itself is barely melted/almost totally solid ice still. It has a nice locking handle that when placed in the upright position snap-locks the lid onto the cooler and locks the thermos between the cooler and the handle (there is a curved recess in the top of the lid that the thermos fits onto and when the handle is in place, that thermos will NOT fall-out accidentally). The cooler is compact and easy to carry, and a appropriately sized (not some huge cooler like you take to the beach).Here are some specifics on the Stanley Thermos/Lunchbox Combo that you might find useful:Thermos:Height: 14 inchesDiameter: 4 inchesCircumference: 12-2/5 inchesComposition of interior: Stainless SteelComposition of exterior: Stainless SteelComposition of Top/Stopper: Plastic/PolymerComposition of Cap/Cup: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: VacuumMaximum Capacity (Volume): 1 Quart (32 fluid ounces or 1/4 Gallon)Country of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]Not Microwave Safe - Do Not MicrowaveGuarantee: Lifetime GuaranteeLunchbox/Cooler:Length: 15 inchesHeight: 7-1/2 inchesWidth: 8-1/2 inchesNumber of Compartments: Two (2)Compartment dimensions: 7-1/8 in. x 7-7/8 in.; & 7-1/8 in. x 4-1/4 in.Composition of interior: Plastic/PolymerColor of Interior: WhiteComposition of exterior: Plastic/PolymerColor of Exterior: GreenComposition of Top: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: Dual-Layer Plastic with foam insulation between.Maximum Capacity (Volume): Approx. 421 cubic inchesCountry of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]I must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design. It is definitely a must-have for students, in offices and commuting to work, on the job where ruggedness is required, and out on the trail. The only drawback I see is that it is made in China instead of the U.S.A. Personally, I'd happily pay double the price for one that was made in U.S.A.

A289MOPXWZ0Z6O,B0019D78H0,M. Miller,"[1, 1]",this is a populer lunchbox I work construction and I've seen this used by a number of guys. I lost my lunch box and was looking into getting a new one. since Ive seen this used by a number of guys I got one. and must say that for the $60 price tage it comes with it a little steep for what you get. but luckely you can get it much cheaper here on amazon make it worth getting. it has two compartments and I think the lid is hard to open not a button type you c on most cooplers mut a lever type that is really hard to manuver but my lunch pal is new ive only had it a couple month and I dont use it right now because I have to open my lunch pal and show it to guards on the way out of the site so I dont want to have to struggle with the lid every day when i leave the site so I take along a playmate I got just have to push a button to open the lid. you cant pack more than a couple of sandwiches and a drink plush chips. so if you pack lite lunches for work then this might be the cooler for you if you get the thermos which adds to the price its a good one and keeps the coffee hot for a long time but you can buy it without the thermos for a cheeper price. maybe after useing it for a while the lever will wear down and become easier to open. all in all i wouldnt buy this cooler but would use it if someone bought it for me.,3,not really worth the price if you ask me,1307232000,"06 05, 2011"

A36VJZIJVQCF7H,B0019DCHBW,"David Smith ""doctorjn""","[37, 39]","Stanley thermoses have been a part of our family for generations, going back to my great grandfather. Stanley has a reputation for ruggedness and high-quality, and this Stanley Outdoor Lunchbox cooler lives-up to that reputation.The cooler has two compartments inside:The larger compartment is 7-1/8 in. x 7-7/8 in. (inside dimensions)and the smaller compartment is 7-1/8 in. x 4-1/4 in. (inside dimensions)The cooler works very well (amazingly well, actually) keeping food nice and cool - I also add one of those plastic ice packs to keep it cold things really cold and at the end of the day the ice pack itself is barely melted/almost totally solid ice still. It has a nice locking handle that when placed in the upright position snap-locks the lid onto the cooler and [if you have a Stanley Thermos] locks the thermos between the cooler and the handle (there is a curved recess in the top of the lid that the thermos fits onto and when the handle is in place, that thermos will NOT fall-out accidentally). The cooler is compact and easy to carry, and a appropriately sized (not some huge cooler like you take to the beach).Here are some specifics on the Stanley Lunchbox that you might find useful:Length: 15 inchesHeight: 7-1/2 inchesWidth: 8-1/2 inchesNumber of Compartments: Two (2)Compartment dimensions: 7-1/8 in. x 7-7/8 in.; & 7-1/8 in. x 4-1/4 in.Composition of interior: Plastic/PolymerColor of Interior: WhiteComposition of exterior: Plastic/PolymerColor of Exterior: GreenComposition of Top: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: Dual-Layer Plastic with foam insulation between.Maximum Capacity (Volume): Approx. 421 cubic inchesCountry of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]I must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design. It is definitely a must-have for students, in offices and commuting to work, on the job where ruggedness is required, and out on the trail. The only drawback I see is that it is made in China instead of the U.S.A. Personally, I'd happily pay double the price for one that was made in U.S.A.

None. I know this because I drilled holes in the lid and box and injected Great Stuff in it to create an ice chest. The divider is useless. I cut it out. For the giant size, it just didn't hold enough. I took a piece of junk and made it better, but had to take a half hour of my time and about $8 to make it keep cool. China....it's made in China.

I do not recommend this product if you want it to act like an ice chest. If you want an overpriced plastic box to hold your food and thermos, go for it.I do recommend insulating it with the Great Stuff. Just drill a few holes the size of the straw. One on each corner and one on each long side. I drilled the holes along the top ridge, in the groove to hide the work a little. To fill the bottom, stick the straw down as deep as you can get it. Do this in all 6 holes you drilled. Then, go back around and fill each hole until it oozes out of the holes. As far as the lid goes, I drilled a hole in each of the ""hex nut pattern"" on the inside of the lid and 1 hole in each corner. Fill it until it oozes. It works pretty good now.

My job currently utilizes firearms and first responder gear.... So to keep this short, here is my list of observations:===PROS===-Pockets are fairly easy to reach/versatile-Rifle bullet loops are in a good place to access while prone (5 cartriges)-Very strong feel, sturdy construction (takes abuse well)-Adjustable to just about any (male) size, shoulders and waist, not weak velcro.-Flashlight/accessory D-loops do not rotate (an irritation when carrying gear on most vests)-Radio pocket is in a good place (keeps the antenna out of my face, close to access even while prone)-Shotgun loops are removable, revealing a good velcro patch to attach any hook-side patch or gear holder-Zipper is not clumsy, button closures help make sure the vest stays zipped, no zipper 'tap noise'-Pistol holster is out of the way, allowing for good movement.====CONS====-Vest can get warm quickly, doesn't breathe well if worn over T-shirt (solid construction, which also makes it slightly noisy, not unlike gym pants)-Pockets are not adjustable, the only thing changeable things on the vest are the shotgun shell loops and the size-Frontal magazine pockets are narrow, they may fight 4 AR mags well (4 slots), but only fit 2 small AK pattern magazines (I've tried to fit more)-Not tailored to left-handed folks (luckily I'm right-handed)-Baton pocket will ONLY fit a long ASP-style baton (any smaller will fall out immediately)-Bullet loops on the shoulder place bullets in an interestingly distracting place on the vest, close to the face.-Thumb release on the holster can be picky.-Shoulder adjustment velcro can bunch and get in the way, but only while donning the vest.OVERALL, for the price it is a really great vest.

However, the magazine pockets will not snap close with either my Sig 1911 or Beretta 92 magazines. The velcro will hold the magazines securely but I would like the extra security of a working snap closure. My local shoe repair shop can easliy move the male snap but this should have been checked by the manufacturer prior to offering the vest for sale.

The other pockets are a bit odd, can't quite figure out what some are meant for, but hey..  whatever.The pistol holster has a snap that is meant to be opened with your thumb, but i cannot do it with only one hand.  the snap is too tight.

This vest is highly adjustable (it fits a friend who is 5'10&#34; 160lbs as well as one who is 6'3&#34; 275lbs) with the modification of several straps, and though it hasn't been tested in any SWAT or combat situations, it appears quite well made and durable. The pocket placement is logical, and they are well sized for various magazines, flashlights, and other survival type gear.The stitching and zippers on this vest look solid, and this vest should stand up well to heavy duty range drills and Airsoft use (if thats your thing.)

Read the reviews like everyone else and got mixed emotions about it. Don't know about the rest of you, but nothing pisses me off more than getting half way through a review just to find out it is by some 12 year old who bought the product for an airsoft match and thinks he is Rambo. Don't get me wrong, my department trains with high quality airsoft guns and they are very effective. Much more cost effective than simunitions. But I think there should be a disclaimer at the beginning of every review done by someone 16 or younger just to save me the trouble. Sorry, had to vent and now I will get back on track. For my purposes, this vest seems to work well. I was able to route my surveillance mike for my radio into the vest and stash some extra AR mags for a grab and go vest. The pistol holster on the vest is an irrelevant addition for me as I would not dare move my sidearm from my duty belt in a shooter situation just to have muscle memory take over and keep trying to draw from an empty waist holster if my AR went down. However it should serve well to secure a recovered weapon or a downed suspect's weapon. There are plenty of pockets for whatever you think you may need and even a pocket that looks to be for an expandable baton which is great since I don't carry mine on my duty belt. It's better off there than at home. I read in one review where someone said the vest was not adjustable. Not true, it is fully adjustable. There is a nice spot on the back for a police patch as well. One thing I have never understood is why you would put shotgun shell holders in an exposed location like that. Try running, crawling, and fighting someone then let me know how many of them bad boys are still there. Must be a LOOK thing. If your carrying shot gun rounds you need a pocket that has the holders inside of it. Like in all my other reviews, if you're on a budget this is a good vest.

The shoulders are adjustable for height via large velcro straps, and for girth there are elastic cords laced up either side.The holster pocket is somewhat goofy, and takes a bit of getting used to.

I wrap it around my neck in between shots, which appears to help my body cool down.  Towards the end of the round, I sometimes get a little headache.

Using the product is easy: take it out, get it wet, and enjoy the coolness. A few comments:1 - When you are done with it, try and lay it somewhere flat and let it COMPLETELY DRY. If you put it back in the plastic case, you will find it gets moldy. I believe these can be machine washed, which should fix the problem, but why even bother with this? Just wring it out, and lay it flat to dry. The pad will be completely dry (and hard) within 8-12 hours. Then you can literally fold it up for storage and later use.2 - The chilly pad works well but it does have one nagging issue (why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5): when you wear it around your neck, the water in the pad tends to migrate down to the ends, leaving the spot right on your neck less wet (and therefore cool) than the ends. A workaround is to wrap the towel so the ends are up on your neck, too.I've found that moving it around helps this problem.

Paper Towels are okay, they still feel cool, since water absorbs heat like crazy. This is the control. However, after using Ergodyne and Frogg Toggs, I noticed that they were significantly cooler, since they stayed cool, where as Your Generic Paper Towels will stop being cool after a few minutes.Anyways, Ergodyne when opened, smelt like gasoline, corn oil, or diesel. Fairly off-putting, I had to use soap and water to clean it. As of right now, (15 minutes later) the Ergodyne is less cool than my Frogg Toggs, suggesting that they evaporate water much quicker than Frogg Toggs.In any case, when I opened the Frogg Toggs, it smelt as if someone wiped their...A** with it. Quite like if you had the mixture of manure and some sort of sour or expired milk. This was the most off-putting of smells. I still smell it faintly, even though it was washed with soap and water.And Paper Towels? I don't think I need to evaluate them, since everyone can test with a paper towel.Findings: All seem to be cool to the touch, but some are a bit cooler than others. Why? I assume that Frogg Toggs absorb and retain the most water, making them the most ""cool"".#3: Paper Towels: Paper Towels are cool, but don't match up to the other two.#2: Ergodyne: Not as effective as Frogg Toggs, but if you're hot you probably won't know/care about the difference.#1: Frogg Toggs: The most effective, but Ergodyne's is a close second.In short, this Frogg Toggs towel is nice and it works, but for fifteen-ish dollars, I feel that I could just use some regular ol' towel for a much cheaper price.Edit: And you could just buy a towel, because I used a new test, a damp shirt. After getting a splash of juice on it, I applied some water and soap. I then questioned the efficacy between a damp shirt and this towel. I then placed my towel near the stain. There was no real difference in temperature between this towel and this a wet shirt. In order to get it cold, I advise placing it in a fridge, or as a chilled plastic bottle water cover.Update: If your towel starts to get warm, please grab the towel and spin it around in a circle.

A2XEIRJCAMR6OV,B001CMVVQ2,"Orrin Boyd ""Orrin""","[16, 19]","Well I now have 3 Rambo 3 knife versions! I will list each one and give a brief review of each one, and then the Summary will be which one I love most. Hang on to your hats folks, it's going to be a bumpy ride!!1st Rambo 3 knife: This is the unbranded, unmarked Rambo 3 knockoff version that is supposedly made in China.  No markings whatsoever on this knife except 440 SS. The knife is tight, elegant, high-quality made, and holds a razor-sharp sure edge. When I first got the knife I was in awe of it.  I love its length, design, and the way it is made, even though it was supposedly a cheapo. However, I learned through testing and through my own research and knowledge that this is surely no knife to be scoffed at and snubbed. I will not go into detail, but my own testing and a surity test from a friend of mine has proven to me that the blade is made with the high quality carbon-filled 440C stainless steel and not the cheapo 440A or 440B stainless steel. You see, in China, marking all of their 440 stainless steel knives with just the 440 is a common thing. Rarely is the C added behind it to distinguish the higher quality 440C ss from the cheaper 440 grades. I tested the blade on my knife and it tested to have a very high amount of carbon content in it, thus explaining why it is holding the wonderful sharp edge that it is holding. Is the knife handmade?  It could be.  But chances are no, and there are other chances that it might be partially handmade. But everything about the knife is exquisitely detailed. The guard is tight and snug against the blade and shows no space whatsoever for looseness or play.  There is absolutely no looseness at all about this knife.  Only drawback about this seemingly high quality Rambo 3 unmarked knife is that the sheath it comes with is pitiful. However, a nice handmade sheath could turn this knife into one hell of a looker/ performer. Recommended?  Yes, you bet!!Hibben III Rambo knife:  Just like the unmarked one I mentioned above, everything on this knife is nice and flush snug and tight!  No space for looseness or play on the knife anywhere! This has the Hibben III logo and, while made in China, surelky proves to be made with absolute detail.  The spine of the blade, the part that is milled and shaped, is different than that of the above knife.  It is truer to movie than the unmarked one.  I love this knife for its super high quality and different spine design, but more importantly for the Hibben III and Gil Hibben signature on it. Mr. Hibben designed an awesome knife when he designed and made the Rambo 3/ Hibben 3 knife, and he should have his personal logo and signature on it; not some movie logo. Recommended? Yes, you betcha!!United Cutlery Rambo 4 UC201 Version: This one was made in 1988 and were the very first Rambo 3 knives ever authorized to be mass produced and produced by United Cutlery.  Therefore by al rights, this version should have the highest quality and best design of all Rambo 3 version knives right???? Wrong! At least not for mine. My UC201 Rambo 3 knife arrived today. Right away I overlooked it, and to my disappointment and dismay, the handle guard Is Not flush and snug against the blade. There is a space gap on both sides, and one side has slightly bigger space gap than the other one. These are not super big gaps but they are big enough for the guard to become loose and jingle and move around. It is tight and secure right now, but who knows how long that will last, right? Also, the guard is placed crooked on the knife, which makes the blade look crooked. Not noticeable unless you are looking for it. The buttcap is snug and tight against the handle, but one side of it overhangs over the handle on the same side, making the buttcap to poke out slightly on that side. This knife is a bit heavier than the two above mentioned ones. My guess is this knife's guard and/ or handle will become loose after a few times of use. Recommended? Because all production knives come out different, and some might be better made than others, I would still recommend this version. However, if you get it and the guard is not tight and flush snug against the blade on all sides, and straight, then I suggest you send it back for an exchange or for a full refund.Now the conclusion of this long drawn-out Rambo knife tale:  Which one do I favor and recommend most?  I would have to say that it is indeed a matching tie between the unmarked one and the Hibben III.  Both have similar qualities and it also depends on if you like the maker's logo on your knives or not. Now out of the two I would choose the Hibben III simply because I like the milled design on the spine of it more than the other one. But without this, I have to say that it is a definite tie between the two, and I definitely would get one of these before I would waste my time and extra money on the 1988 United Cutlery version.  And there it is.  Thanks for reading!!!",5,Rambo 3 Knife Rocks!!!,1325116800,"12 29, 2011"

Also, upon opening these rings I decided that I wanted to check the fit of just the bottom half of one of the rings to my scope, so I slipped the bottom half of one of the rings on and it didn't just slide right in. The ring (both of them actually) were not quite cut round to fit the contour of the scope tube, and were machined quite roughly on the inside. So, having just slipped the ring on basically just to see how it looked, I removed the bottom half of the ring and some of my scope's coating with it.

The idea of having these scope rings, was that I'd be able to mount a heavy-duty scope to it, and be able to remove quickly should the need for open sights demand it (such as a broken scope).The good?1.  These rings WILL do that.  The six screws on each ring securely hold my scope in place, and I'm quite confident that there won't be any problems with things sliding around, coming loose.2.  They're CHEAP, as in price.The bad?1.  While the rings easily clamp to the scope, as you tighten the rings, they tend to pull the scope off of level.  It was a struggle to get the scope exactly level with the rifle, so that this variable could be eliminated from my shooting.  It was a *serious* PITA to get it all square.2.  In the picture for the rings, the right pic (which shows the bottom of the ring, where it clamps to the rail), the screw on the left side of that pic is not adequately captured in the hole.  That is, as you loosen the nut, the screw (which has almost a carriage-bolt head on it) immediately becomes loose, and literally falls out the bottom of the hole.  The clamp under the nut on the right side is held in place by a small bevel, but is ALSO not really held in place.  In other words, as soon as you loosen up the nut to remove from the Picatinny rail, ALL the hardware that you see on the bottom of the ring falls out!  Ignoring the fact that you really do NOT want to lose any hardware bits from this disassembling all on its own, without the hardware being captured, it's almost impossible to put it all back together again with the scope attached to the rings.3.  I'm uncertain as to how much abuse these will hold up to...  while the clamping to the scope is excellent, the base clamping system....  just *sucks.*  I doubt it will tolerate much in the way of abuse.Overall, if you plan to simply mount your scope and NEVER take it off, then these will probably be dandy, for a decent price.

The backpack will hold a little more than that but not too much.

A1MC04JNV32M0N,B001HSNPTW,Niko,"[6, 7]","This is a great messenger bag, but there is a catch: the velcro strap that closes the bag is too short. To attach the velcro strips, you have to roll the top of the bag a few times over, then reach over with the strap. Doing this costs you 6-8 inches in height or about 30% in storage capacity compared to when the mouth of the bag is open. I learned this the hard way after my first visit to the grocery store. At two-thirds full, the bag could barely close. I had no choice but to fill it up and bike home with the top of the bag wide open. This could have all been avoided if the velcro strap was 5 to 6 inches longer.Storage contraints aside, the bag is great. It's waterproof and comfortable. The foam ribs on the back actually help to improve air circulation. Your back will still be sweaty after a long ride, but it's not nearly as bad as it would be with a flat backpack. There is also a detachable pouch inside to store stuff like your phone and wallet. The lack of an outside compartment is a bit of a drawback though. Another caveat is that the bag rides a bit high on your back and partially blocks your field of vision - a really big deal if you're on a road bike. Handle bar mirrors would be a good complement to this bag.I would recommend this backpack if just need something comfortable and waterproof that can carry a fair load. By fair load, I mean a U-lock, a change of clothes, shoes and maybe a laptop. If you plan on carrying larger loads such as weekly groceries, laundry or camping gear, I would recommend going with a higher capacity bag.

These are my thoughts and may help you.Short and simple.. an alright big box bike(idealy for someone 160#s or less), and at least it's not a bicycle shape'd object. Schwinn is owned by a company known as Pacific cycle company, made in China. With that out of the way... It's better than a 'mart bike.1.) The shifters are decent, shimano entry level quality.2.) A few things that everyone askes, what is the weight? The box it ships in weighs more than the bike, the bike IIRC weighed about 32-36#s.3.) Front and Rear Derailluers are pretty good. Take the bike to a LBS(Local Bike Shop) for adjustments if you feel that adjusting it is over-welming. I adjusted mine, set the H/L limits shifters worked perfectly. Although I understand that adjustments are not easy for everyone, so if it seems too much LBS's will help you get it on the road/trail.4.) I found it to be a common review problem that the front rotor disc was warped. I own a Park Tool Rotor Truing Fork - DT-2C , that you'll need anyways (5-10bucks) pick up one from a LBS or Amazon for a little more, to true the warped rotor. This tool will save you money instead of having to buy a new rotor.5.) The coilover (rear shock) on mine had a blown dampener, shockeye lenght is 6.5 inches BTW. I bought a aftermarket coilover for it, no more boing-gy. SR Suntour front fork is entry level and was frustrating on a uphill climb (NO Lockout) and rode pleasently otherwise, not just for looks.6.) 26"" wheels are light, and the spokes needed major tightening. Shr valves. F/R has V-brake surfaces machined on them and can be ""handed-down"" to your kids 26er' if they don't have disc brakes. Tires have a waxy coating to keep mud from sticking, that wears off the nubies as you ride. The tires are fairly aggressive too.7.) The cassette (Rear sprocket) seems stout. I'm 240#s pulling an extra 70#s no catastrophic failure as some mentioned but YMMV.8.) Rear swingarm has a mount for disc brake. I used the front caliper mounting bracket to mount a caliper on the the rear. You will need another rear wheel that is compatible with disc brakes.9.) The seatpost is alloy, and 27.2mm not 25.4mm as Schwinn states. This seatpost uses a hex-key to adjust angle.10.) 1 1/8"" threadless stearer tube with typical big-box-bike headset. Lightweight stem and handlebar aswell.11.) Seat is like a rock, but who sits on a MTB seat?If you are not too critical on the bike, this is a great bike for a growing kid or someone looking for a entry level full suspension bike.

A3VIRG27TO2IO6,B001IANSJ6,Xak,"[1, 2]","I was a little leary about buying a bike from Amazon instead of going to my local bike shop. I am pleased with this as I probably spent half as much as I would have buying at the bike shop. If you are concerned I hope I can alleviate some of those concerns, as I probably had them too.My first of course was, would the bike be good. Well, as far as I can tell, the bike is as good as one bought in a shop. You do have to assemble, and it's not all professionally tuned up like they might tell you at a shop, but it's not difficult.Next I wondered if putting it together myself would be wise. As I said above, it was not difficult. If you have done any work at all on a bike, you can put this together. The bike comes with the chain, rear suspension and rear tire all together. You have to put the handlebars up, put the front tire on, screw on the pedals and post the seat. The only part I had a problem with was the front tire. The user manual/instruction booklet was useless to me in this sense. I, funnily enough, recommend not even opening it unless you have literally never done any work on anything ever.The front tire has a quick release doodad, and this is something you have to put together yourself. The instructions had very simple pictures for doing this, and I found it to be misleading. I ended up unscrewing the bolts that hold the spoke hub casing in place. All you have to do is unscrew the quick release end cap and stick it through the  hub hole. The wheel comes with cap guards over this hole, and part of that cap broke off into the hole, which was part of the cause for my confusion as I didn't look closely at it. That brings me to my next point.The shipment arrived in fairly poor condition. The box had hand holes, but they were ripped all to hell. It looked like someone wondered what I bought and tried to open the box also. The main box was in better shape, but still not great. This delivery definitely saw some action. This action cause some damage to the guards that I mentioned above. Luckily they were in place or I might have had to submit returns or buy new wheels. There was also a chip in the paint on the front suspension.Over all I am very pleased with this purchase. I got to work with my hands, and saved some money. I would likely buy a bike from Amazon again.",4,Please with purchase,1376006400,"08 09, 2013"

I also tried one of those drip things - messy & coffee gets cold and not enough oppty to ""brew"".Couple of hints: stir the coffee & very hot water a bit before letting it sit. (Don't shake it as an idiot friend of mine did - ending up with coffee grounds & hot water all over him.)Only press down once - don't ""pump"" it. You'll end up with ""crunchy"" coffee. The insulator does a decent job keeping it hot while it ""brews"".When pouring out the grounds, you'll have some on the top filter section - make sure it's screwed in well or it will go flying when you try to bang them off. (I had to go hunting to find it in the brush)It's been a solid performer. Add a bit more coffee than you think you need. Don't press it down with all your strength - it's made of plastic, not steel! The filter/screen of the press is quite fine, so you can grind your beans as much as you want.If you like 2 cups in the morning, don't pour hot water in for both cups at the same time - it isn't that well-insulated. A friend tried putting it in a couple of clean socks for extra insulation... not the brightest idea, it fell over. It has a nice rubberized bottom for traction.Enjoy...

A1QFFRX44YPXX8,B001LF3I48,"Andrew J. Riemer ""Andrew James Riemer""","[63, 63]","My wife and I wanted to be able to brew coffee during a wilderness trip, but did not want to bother with a percolator.  I've seen press pots before, and was willing to try one, so I did some research before settling on the 30 oz. GSI Outdoors Java Press.  I figured it was a good entry level price point, and it would let me gauge whether I would want another one.  Well, I've had it about a year and have used it regularly, both at home and afield, and can say that it's the only coffee maker I carry when camping now, and the quality is such that I'm not planning to replace it (except, perhaps, with the larger one).The first thing I noticed was the packaging.  The box is of good quality and was designed so that the press can be repackagd when not in use.  I did that for the first few months (wanting to protect my little investment), but soon took to keeping it where it was handy.The 30 oz. capacity is perfect if using an ultralight kettle, or a 1 qt. pot.  If working with a 2 qt. pot, you can fill up the press and still have enough water for your other cooking and cleaning needs.  This pot produces six traditional 5 oz. cups of coffee, but my wife and I typically got three cups between us using our larger camp mugs.  Thus, I found it to be the perfect size for a two-person outing.No Worries About Glass Breakage-------------------------------Most press pots I had seen had glass cannisters. That's something I didn't want, because I know that navigating the trail doesn't lend itself to keeping everything free from bumps and scrapes.  After using it, I see no benefit to using glass.  It is suggested that you pre-rinse the canister with hot water before each use.  Admittedly, I did not do that during hot weather, as I figured the air was warm enough, but I made sure I did so during colder conditions.  I didn't want the cannister cracking on me.  I've used it with air temps as cool as 28F, and as hot as 104F.The cannister itself is plain and simple apart from the pour spout (older version had a plastic handle).  For the current model, the handle is attached to the insulating sleeve, and pouring while my hand is slipped through the web handle feels comfortable.  The sleeve is vented on the bottom, to make it easier to slide on and off, and has a small window on one side to monitor the fill level. As someone else has already mentioned, not having a plastic handle sticking out makes this one much easier to pack.Plunger Concerns? None Here---------------------------Some of the reviews I read (here and on other sites) suggested that the plastic plunger was a poor design choice, and that some users had them break quickly.  I feared the shaft for the plunger was going to be plastic, but was pleased to find it made of sturdy metal (stainless?), and that it threaded onto both the plunger disk and the press knob. Personally, I've had no problems with the plunger assembly during my first year of use.  I just remember not to try to force it when I encounter resistance.Every once in a while, when I do encounter a lot of resistance when I try to press down the plunger, I just follow the instructions that came with the pot: I pull the plunger up a bit before starting down again.  That typically takes care of it.  I press with slow, steady pressure.  You shouldn't treat the plunger like it's the response button on a game show.The Grind Does Matter (Maintenance is Easy)-------------------------------------------During the first year of use, I ended up with one batch of cofee that was ground too fine (likely remnants in the grinder at the store when I went to fill a bag), and they got into the screen and even wedged along the o-ring on the plunger.  Disassembly was simple, however, requiring only a small screwdriver, and I had the unit reassembled very quickly.  If you have a choice of the type of coffee you use, I recommend a coarser grind setting.  That said, we've used it in the house with mass-market Foldgers, and it has worked just fine.Flavor, Cleanup, and Summary----------------------------The press method seems to delivery a stronger, richer flavor that you typically see in a drip coffeemaker, and cleanup is much simpler than with a percolator (especially when camping). I've been very pleased with it, and I recommend it highly. I originally planned it as a starter press, with plans to purchase a better one if I liked using this one.  After my first year, I love using the press, but have no plans to replace this one.  I plan to use it for a very long time.  Since our eldest kids have started drinking coffee when we camp, however, I might need to go back and get a second one, or the larger 50 oz. model.",5,"First press, very impressed",1294185600,"01 05, 2011"

I was weary pouring super hot water into a plastic container, but it steamed up and other than that, had no effect on the plastic.

Sometimes I have problems with goggles having the eye cups too close together, but these are perfect for me.  I love the adjustment system on these because it's easy to change the length of the straps if needed.  God how I hated the old style where you had to adjust the goggle on the side of the temple with those hard plastic threads.Peripheral vision:Unlike a lot of other goggles that have a flat front lens and then a second side lens, these lenses are curved.  That means that you get an unobstructed, SEAMLESS, peripheral view, and I love that!  I do wish it curved even a bit further around, but don't get me wrong, they're still great as-is.Goggle Case:I did buy the TYR goggle case and although it has worked really well (and prevented a ton of scratches), it's almost too small for the goggle.  You have to bunch up everything and then hold the goggles and the straps in the case and then zip it closed slowly while pushing everything in that's popping back out.  If I could do it again, I'd buy it only if I couldn't find a case that was a bit bigger.Fogging up:I don't knock a goggle down for fogging up because there are so many conditions that effect this.  Fogging is caused by your body warming the air in the goggle and then cold water hitting the outside of the lens.  The cold lens and warm air make contact and that causes condensation on the inside.  The ONLY thing a company can do is put an anti-fog solution on the inside of the lens, and no company has figured out how to make that coating permanent.  It will eventually come off of EVERY goggle.  You can spit in your lens, rub it around, and then shake it out with water, this creates a film.  Or, you can buy some JAWS Quick Spit that does the same thing, only a bit better.  Either way, goggles are going to fog, and if they don't fog right when you get them, it's not going to be long until they do.  Anti-fog solution is cheap and lasts a long time, and in my view, should be a part of every goggle purchase.Have a great swim!",5,Great fit and no leaks,1328313600,"02 04, 2012"

I had purchased theSchwinn Adjustable Kickstandfor my mountain bike but the rear brake assembly is right where the kickstand is supposed to go, so I stuck it on another bike and bought this one. Despite coming without instructions, it was very easy to install--although it did require two different size hex keys and a pair of pliers. Three different clamps are provided to fit your particular frame. The stand is plenty sturdy, easily adjusts in length and has a nice rubber foot. I especially like that it folds up out of the way without interfering with the spokes or with the trailer attachment on the rear hub.

The swing arm has a combination of round and square tubing.  I'm not sure if this is typical of all mountain bikes or if it's just my bike.  Either way, the square tubing the top part of the kickstand uses as a brace point made it difficult to install the round clamp.  The kit comes with several sizes, and even with the largest clamp I had to do a little work to get it to bolt in place.  Once bolted in though, the sucker isn't moving.The kickstand itself has an odd quirk though.  While stored, I have to really force it down.  I fear one day I might break it since it sometimes doesn't want to budge.  Maybe this is an poor adjustment on my part, perhaps it needs a little lubrication, or maybe it's just how this stand is.

A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,B001OQXGP0,A. H.,"[2, 4]","I've owned various utility and camping knives over the years, from a Puma Backpacker forged in Solingen, Germany that I got as a young teen to Swiss Army knives and a few other folding blades.  This American made Kershaw knife is among my favorites for its size, ergonomics, fit and finish, and blend of features.First off, the G-10 scale makes it easy for a right handed person to keep a grip on this knife, even when working in wet conditions.  G-10 is a composite with fiberglass at its core, and it provides an excellent traction surface.  It's also tough as nails.  The reverse side of the knife is finished stainless steel.  It doesn't have a separate scale on it -- the stainless steel side is part of the knife's frame.  It's fairly substantial and includes the ""frame lock"" feature that, when the blade is deployed, keeps the knife rock solid -- that blade doesn't wiggle a bit.  It's still easy to close the knife, but it does take two hands.  It's an ingenious system.  Because that side of the knife is a slab of stainless steel, and because the frame lock feature works by having a part of the frame move behind the blade when deployed, there is a cut in the back side that allows that part of the frame to move and provide this useful function.The blade, made of a high carbon steel specifically engineered to provide durable and sharp cutting edges for knives and razors, is easy to deploy.  The knife has a leveraged system.  You pull on the small knurled fixture on the back of the knife near the blade's pivot point, and the blade deploys readily.  (This is not like Kershaw flipper knives where you generally need to flick your wrist while pulling an extended tang -- compare with the Skyline, for example.  This one will fully deploy the blade just by pulling on the knurled fixture.  My wife, who cannot easily open a flipper knife, deploys this blade with no problem.  That's the advantage of levers, as Archimedes would have told you.  Still, it requires enough deliberate force that, unless you're the type who routinely runs with scissors and acts carelessly with razor sharp knives, you're not going to deploy it accidentally when removing it from your pocket.)  With the blade deployed, the knurled fixture finds repose in a recess in the back of the knife, giving it smooth lines.  Another reviewer complains that the knurled deploying fixture might cause injury.  Unless you go around indiscriminately thrusting your hands into your pockets with great force, however, I can't see that being a realistic problem.  The fixture is round.  You'd really have to punch your hand into your pocket before that would pose any kind of a risk to you.  You'd be more likely to cut yourself on your car keys.  Or a quarter.The edge is razor sharp and well ground from the factory.  This knife has a blade just over 3 inches long and is useful for many small chores.  The point is very fine, however, so it obviously isn't for heavy piercing tasks -- with a harder stainless steel blade like this one, you might break the point if you use it for heavy piercing or prying.  But it's a marvelous utility knife for edge uses.  I was surprised by the thickness of the back side of the blade -- thicker than a Kershaw Blur.As with many Kershaw knives, there are two sets of small screw holes that permit the owner to reverse the clip, which is well-finished stainless steel and laser engraved with the Kershaw name.At bottom, this is a great value and shows that Americans are still adept at manufacturing cleverly-engineered high quality goods.  In the hand, this knife simply feels like it was manufactured to specific tolerances.  It's light but feels substantial.  The fit and finish are excellent.  While some people who demand absolute symmetry in everything might not like the stainless steel side of the knife, it gives the knife a unique look.  (It vaguely reminds me of those Swiss watches that allow you to see some of the gears in the movement through the face -- the engineering is obvious and part of what makes the knife attractive.)  To each his own, I suppose.  Just don't let it blind you to the fact that this is one handy EDC knife.",5,Excellent value in an American made knife,1294531200,"01 09, 2011"

It came very sharp but has dulled with use, so I sent it off to Kershaw and they sharpened it for free and shipped it back to me for free. I love the opening stud. There is sort of a leverage action built into the opening system where the blade rotates faster than the opening stud. This makes for a very quick opening knife with a solid feel. I open it with both my thumb or index finger and I always have enough traction so that my finger does not slip off. I also have the Kershaw Leek and even though this knife does not have the Speedsafe feature, it opens just as quickly (I have had friendly ""quick draw"" contests with my brother and his Leek and the OD-1 is often the one out and open the fastest) One more very important feature is the option to reverse the pocket clip. I prefer to carry my pocket knives butt up so that I do not have to rotate the knife once I take it out of my pocket. Too often I have to grab for my knife with only one hand and turning it around is one unnecessary step that I like to avoid. Do not hesitate if you are considering buying this knife.

I couldn't find a replacement, since the stores around here have stopped supplying them, and no other knife can replace this one (in my opinion). Steady, well built knife that will, without a doubt, last a lifetime.-BladeThe 14C28N steel that Kershaw used in this blade is superb.  Holding an edge and staying strong is the name of the game here.  This grade of steel is not only easy to sharpen, but provides excellent corrosion resistance.  Knife comes razor-sharp out of the box.  14C28N steel makes the hollow-ground blade perfect for EDC.  There is no play in the blade when deployed, and the frame-lock holds the blade in place perfectly.I don't buy any other type of steel for a knife, anymore.  There is just something about 14C28N that makes it so easy to sharpen and it stays sharp.  Most knives can be sharpened, but the edge on a properly sharpened 14C28N blade FEELS sharper than any blade that I have ever worked with.  You can feel when it starts to dull by rubbing your thumb on it and you can feel when it is properly sharpened the same way.People have said that there is a rust factor for this steel type, and I have seen that first-hand.  That being said, if you use the blade continuously, or store it properly, it should not rust on you.  The only time I have seen this stuff rust was when I stored it in my basement without oil for several months.  And, even then, it only got TINY spots of rust here and there.  Nothing to speak of, and nothing that couldn't be fixed with a little care and use, once again.  Again, it's a perfect material for a perfect knife.-HandleG-10 material on one side provides excellent traction and grip.  Under the G-10 is the set of parts that make it an ""overdrive"" knife.  A simple lever-runner setup makes the blade deployment super quick and super smooth with the phosphor-bronze washers.  This deployment isn't spring-assisted, and is very unique to this device.  You just have to use it to understand what I am talking about.The opposite side of this handle is bead-blasted steel.  Offering a frame-lock, you are given the most secure blade you can ask for on this device, along with a feature that surprised me:  A frame-lock stabilizer.  This kind of feature is usually not seen until you get into the more EXPENSIVE knives, but is a VERY welcome feature in this knife.-Pocket clipVery simple and excellently designed pocket clip.  Can be used tip-up or tip-down, and set for left-handed carry in a tip-up style on the newer designs.  There is no hocus-pocus going on with the clip and that makes it extremely functional.  This clip gets what it needs to get done, and it does it perfectly well.-ConclusionThis is an excellent EDC knife that will always be in my hall of fame.  I now have several in my possession, just ""in case"" so I will never be without one.  I have gotten into the habit of buying up all that I find, regardless of how many I already have.I would recommend this knife to everyone that carries or uses a pocket knife.  It redefines EDC and provides the maximum amount of functionality along with beauty.  Excellent gift for a friend, family member, or for yourself!",5,Excellent knife.,1318723200,"10 16, 2011"
ARDO7Q29BGCYQ,B001OQXGP0,M. T. Rice,"[4, 4]","I guess by now I'm one of those ""knife guys."" I really do enjoy collecting knives and this is one of my favorites. Originally, I got this knife in-store from Academy Sports and owned it for about half a year before it disappeared. I hadn't found it after several months, so I just decided to buy it online here. The shipping was as expected and the delivery condition was un-jacked up.Now, as to this knife, there are plenty of youtube reviews and others on here say a lot of good things already, so my review work is sort of redundant, but I want to add to it anyway, so I will. For those of you interested and having never owned this sort of knife before, that spur sticking out on the back works just like an American flip light switch or, for those of you with guns, much like the ""pulling on the trigger"" of an inexperienced gun user. This knife is also a pure right handed opening knife, the clip is not for either side and the opening will prove a little awkward with the frame lock exposed as it is. The scales make the gripping on the left side pretty easy, but the right side is just metal and there's no thumb gimping on the spine or sides of the frame. None of this is necessarily bad, it's just worth mentioning. The blade itself is seems like it's changed a little, maybe a different steel and seems thicker than the previous one I've lost. The point is something wicked and not to be rough used like gouging a tree. It would be quite useful in light field use like digging out a splinter though. I carry this as an every day carry blade and would recommend that use for others as well. This is a good knife, even if it is a bit on the expensive side. I'll add pictures of mine as well.",5,"Sweet, fast EDC blade",1302566400,"04 12, 2011"

I really like the OD-1 and OD-2's flipper design because I feel that I have more control of the blade opening. You can open it as fast or as slow as you desire. In addition, if you bump the blade while opening it, you can finish opening it with the flipper unlike other flipper style knives where you have to flick your wrist or close and re-open it. I do not like the two different sides of the OD_1 though. It has a G-10 scale on one side and the metal frame on the other. The OD-2 has G-10 on both sides.",4,Kershaw OD-1,1294617600,"01 10, 2011"

It's VERY light, it's relatively thin, it's reasonably priced, it's VERY sharp out of the box, the pocket clip is reasonably strong and well-made (although it's not reversible), and it's made in the USA - several very nice points. However, it's riveted together (no adjustments, Torx screws would've been nicer), it feels a little bit flimsy in some ways, and the spring strength is absurdly strong. Seriously, it's almost on par with a Cold Steel Tri-Ad lock in terms of how hard it is to disengage the lock, and it takes a LOT of effort to overcome the spring tension just to open the thing via the thumb stud. Perhaps if they'd carved out a recess in the handle to dig your thumb into the thumbstud a little better and/or put the thumb stud farther down away from the pivot point of the hinge, it would reduce the effort required to open the blade. Even a bit of Teflon-infused oil and a LOT of break-in work on the lockback spring did nothing to reduce the opening effort.If they just made the thing a little easier to open and maybe put it together with screws instead of rivets, it would be an AWESOME little knife for the money.

A2BX8DDQGCCG2J,B001RMUTYM,MWebb,"[3, 3]","I'd pretty much bought into the over-seas value proposition - that Asian factories could produce outstanding pocket knives at dirt cheap prices - and it came as a shock to find out that Buck, an old American knife tradition, could also build a quality pocket knife, at an astonishingly low price ... but IN AMERICA.I mean in the rush for ever low prices while maintaining quality, we've already seen mass market knife making shift from Japan to Taiwan and now to mainland China. So finding good quality, materials, and construction in an American made knife in this day and age at a low price is amazing.The 3 Bucklite Max's that I own are all made in America. The first one, date coded from 2011, does not have a clip or thumb studs, and the blade profile is very (very) slightly different from the current design. The current design has both a pocket clip and thumb studs for one handed opening, although the lock spring is strong (as it should be for a safe lock up) and it takes a good grip and a little pressure (and care) to open with a single hand - something you can do with a little patience if your other hand is occupied, but something that could be a struggle under pressure.The current design BuckLite Maxs that I own are date coded from 2011 and 2012; I don't know when the pocket clipped, thumb studded edition first started, or whether the 2011 edition I have was a limited promotional item (it came with another knife). I prefer the thumb stud edition, since the studs are out of the way and are smoothly finished and hence unlikely to catch in the bottom and start opening the knife (the strong spring also helps a lot in this regard). I have mixed feelings about pocket clips; I've removed them from most of my pocket knifes, to slim them down, but I have to admit even if you carry loose in the pocket, like I do, the clip gives the fingers of my hand a little ""ledge"" to grab on to while using my thumb on the other side of the handle to swing the blade out. This particular pocket clip is very-well designed, since the top is flush with the knife handle top for deep-carry. It's a firm clamp, but since the handle materials are smooth, doesn't have the kind of ""death grip"" that Cold Steel and Spyderco tend to have. I prefer the Buck design since it is less wearing on the pocket, but there is a slightly greater risk of loss if something brushes the clip up. Please note that the clip is non-removable, it is part of the rivet assembly to the rear of the handle. The other two fasteners are also non-adjustable rivets (front of handle and middle).There are pros and cons to rivets and threaded fasteners. Rivets don't loosen, and they are much quicker and cheaper to assemble. Threaded fasteners allow adjusting tension on edge lock folders (which this is not, it's a lock back) and sometimes allow disassembly of the knife for ""deep cleaning."" I think both are fine; Cold Steel used rivets on the ultra popular Voyagers for years, and Spyderco did the same with their Delicas and Enduras (both companies have shifted to threaded fasteners for their current editions). The one negative about fasteners is that if they are too tight for easy opening, or loose enough to allow blade wobble, they can't be adjusted. Buck nailed the tension on my three samples: compared with some older 110's with minimal blade wobble, the three BuckLite Max 482's I have hit the perfect spot of no blade wobble yet easy opening, just like all the Voyagers and Delicas of yore. In an American made product!I used to be dubious of 420HC. 420 has a bad reputation for a quality knife steel, but 420HC is a different story. It is very easy to sharpen, yet seems to hold an edge comparable to other modern mass production steels like AUS8. All it takes it 2-3 very light strokes per side on 20 degree angle ceramic sticks to re-set the edge, followed by light stropping on the cardboard back of a legal pad, to set a very fine edge (as measured by ""slicing"" copier paper cleanly). (The actual factory edge angle appears to be closer to 25 degrees, but the 20 degree setting on my sharpening kit works fine, setting up a slight secondary angle.) As others have mentioned, what 420HC gives up in edge retention it gains in edge toughness, reportedly being less likely to chipping than some more brittle factory steels. What it gives up in edge retention, it gives back in terms of ease of resharpening.If you liked the classic Voyagers and Delicas with no metal lining to the plastic handles, you will love the all FRN (fiberglass reinforced nylon) handles on the BuckLite Max - thick enough to have little to no flex, but very light due to the lack of a metal brace.If you miss the last-generation Voyager with liner-less plastic handles, or want something a little bigger than the still-current Gerber LST (the original classic ""all plastic"" handled knife), this is the one for you. If you are looking for a better built - bordering on over-built - utility knife that is robust enough to be worthy of tactical consideration, check out the current Cold Steel Voyager series with their much stockier handles than the last generation. If you want a slimmer pocket knife with a similar design - FRN handles with no liner, lockback, thumb stud and pocket clip, the Kabar Dozier falls into the same price range (but is made in Taiwan last I checked).Overall though, owning a piece of American knife making tradition for just $20 is almost irresistible.",5,"Superb Design, Materials, Construction...and AMERICAN Made!",1369094400,"05 21, 2013"

A2N8APC0G9M3QM,B001RMUTYM,The Mountaineer,"[3, 3]","I don't know if this will post different and say this is the large version or not,which I did buy but on amazon it was a gift for someone.The medium model I bought at a K-Mart about four years ago on sale,two dollars cheaper and I'd have it right then?why the hell not.So let's review the knife...Why Did I buy this knife?In full blown honesty the Buck Ranger was my pocket knife before modern knives came about,unfortunately it was somewhat hefty and lacked the one-handed convenience.The medium-sized Max seemed to be a good alternative to what I liked about the Ranger in modern form.It's not 100% like the Ranger but same steel,same blade length,lockback,similarity in blade shape...you get the idea.Nylon Scales:The handles have some texturing and it's a comfortable grip,I've drop it plenty of times and it's holding up well.The scales you can flex a little but not as much because the full length lockback makes it more solid,the Bantam it's much more evident.Can't really down the construction of a seventeen dollar knife it could be more solid with steel liners but it would add some weight...this is nice and light.Lockback Function:The opening of the blade isn't isn't slick like liner lock but it opens comfortably one-handed and locks up tight and just like a normal lockback closes two-handed.The blade does have some throw to it like a Buck Ranger so be ready for that.The thumb-studs for some reason I really like them...theyr'e nothing fancy they just are flat headed with nice tapering rather than pointy.Clip-Point Blade:The blade came very sharp out of the blister pack and not surprising had a sweet hollow grind with swedgework.According to Buck it's a drop-point but it's too sleek and contoured,extremely close to being the clip-point style not so widely used on modern knives...great balance of curve and straight edge.The finish is okay it is a satin finish but Buck does a stone tumble method so the steel turns out flawed/scratched looking.The blade is very comfortable ad great for yard work or utility use.420HC Stainless Steel:This is a inexpensive blade steel and it's went under various names such as Schrade USA's Plus Steel and Imperial's Double Eagle blade steel...alot of hyped names for stainless steel on older knives back then.But if this steel wasn't on this knife I probably wouldn't be as happy with it,it's one of my favorite steels...has strong and weak points.Cutting weeds,meats,wood carving,and even cleaning game this steel holds a pretty good edge life.Use primarily for utting coarse fabrics and cardboard you'll wear the edge quicker than any stainless,high end heat treatment or not.Phenomenal edge wear properties though because it's so soft-harder steels are more likely to chip over time through hard use because they're brittle,420HC?it just gets dull...very hard working steel.Considering how long it remains sharp and the little sharpening time involved 420HC remains a overlooked steel to some,very appreciated by others because they know the qualities behind it.Pocket Clip:The MAX is actually designed to be only for right handed carry for it's friendly price tag. but.All your hand contacts is the lockback spine so your key ring can't snag on the blade or your fingers contact the thumb-studs.It is a consolidated design by going this route but it hasn't been a crutch on my enjoyment of the knife.The steel clip is screwed on it's riveted but it's still tight,rides flush in your pocket,and it's not a chunky knife so it's pretty cozy.Final Thoughts:For seventeen to twenty dollars?yeah it's a pretty good knife by Buck.Of the Bucklite Series I think the MAX is more sturdy than the Bantam,zytel plastic construction and only half-length lockback design isn't quite as promising in durability.But the MAX does have a pretty good value behind it with no fluff to gimmick around...just function.5-stars!",5,BUCK Max 482 (Medium) Knife Review,1363132800,"03 13, 2013"

A29ZEV20RCXV1D,B001T9QYR4,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[4, 5]","I think one of the areas where it gets 'very' murky is exactly 'who' is making 'what' -- I'll explain that: The Umarex 'airgun' folks commonly uses the brand name 'firearm' in various of their products, for example, the Umarex manufactured 'Beretta CX-4' or in the instant case the Umarex made 'Walther' flashlight and dot laser causing some folks to believe that the item is manufactured by Beretta or Walther or 'whatever' brand name 'firearm' manufacturer when in fact it just may be an 'airgun' replica item and in fact made for airguns versus firearms. So too, witness the fiasco over the ""real"" vs ""airgun"" replica of the Beretta CX-4 where that ""tri-rail"" piece has users going bananas [read the reviews!] because the tri-rail [which is an after-market 'accessory' and does 'not' come with the gun, real =or= airgun variety] mounting screws won't fit and in 'some' cases the 4 screws will not fit 'either' the real Beretta CX-4 or the 88 gram CO2 airgun .177 pellet firing replica version! This flashlight/laser product is having similar hassles because it won't mount properly! Read on.That said, I note various Walther 'firearm' owners saying the flashlight and laser sight gizmo doesn't fit their 'real' Walther handgun weapon. But it gets worse --- if you go to the Umarex USA website, it says and I quote the Umarex website itself, to wit: ""Integrated mount fits Weaver and Picatinny rails, spring tension"" [sic] -- just TRY slipping on that mount to ANY Weaver or Picatinny rail and see what happens! The moment it reaches the spring tension piece [with that tiny screw holding down the metal spring tension in the middle of the mount], it refuses to go any further without wrestling with the thing and one long term airgun enthusiast I know who loved the idea of an integrated red dot laser sight 'and' the flashlight combo [with its 4 way switch] gave up the ghost and removed the spring tension piece and 'shimmed' it to fit his airgun rail so as  to avoid mount wobble. But this should 'not' be necessary when the clear implication BY UMAREX who makes the thing that it ""... fits Weaver and Picatinny rails ... "" [sic]. Perhaps it does but not without a gigantic struggle [and which still may not work!] and/or tinkering with it or modifying it which of course, if you do that, can have warranty voiding issues! Yeah, sure, you could always replace the tension spring and the tiny screw after tinkering with it to fit but, again, this should not be necessary in the first place!Sidebar: While I have many Umarex ""fun gun"" products and am generally pleased with them, especially the Umarex made Beretta .177 =30= pellet rotary clip and 88 gram CO2 propulsion airgun replica of the 'real' Beretta CX-4 firearm, I note [and I'll have to dig up the specific model airgun and add it in an addendum to this review], anyway, one of the Umarex made 'Walther' replica CO2 [using the 'Big Momma' 88 gram cylinder] ""airgun rifles"" was designed to only fit 88 gram ""Walther"" manufactured 88 gram CO2 cylinders and will 'not' accept the Walther brand competition 88 gram cylinder, the Crosman manufactured so-termed ""Air Source"" 88 gram CO2 cylinder [which has a shorter 'neck' than the Walther cylinder] where the 'why' of this design which de facto 'forces' using only Walther 88 gram cylinders vs Crosman 88 gram cylinders totally escapes me! A word to the wise for airgun hobbyists. In virtually all other CO2 powered airguns [pistols or rifles], the user can use any brand of CO2 cylinders whether the popular 12 gram or 88 gram cylinders. Back to the Walther flashlight and laser sight -- the mount is a decided problem and it should NOT be up to the user to fiddle or tinker with it when the literature clearly states that it will fit ANY Weaver or Picatinny rail!

I had previously owned an 8wt graphite rod but the rod was over 30 years old and broke during a fishing session.My first impressions is that this rod even though is a two piece, is very sensitive.  I could feel the fish through the rod even if they gently took the fly and when fighting the fish I always knew I was hooked up.  This rod also casts extremely well.  It loads then propels the line through the guides so smoothly you need less effort to cast.  With my fiberglass rods you really have to bend the rod with the flyline forcefully to get a similar result.  My 5wt is the same size and number of pieces as this Okuma rod and the Okuma rod is superior in every way.I really enjoyed my first few hours of fishing with this rod.

This is because the individual liquid vile packaging was somehow discontinued, and I have a child with severe nut allergy. The liquid form can go down fast when allergic reaction start to block air passage.I fill 30mL in the bottle (maximum is 37mL or 1.25 flat oz). Once closed, I tried to squeeze hard and the cap was able to stay shut. This was a good sign..until I take it on a road trip that climbed over a mile high. At destination where we gained 6,200ft in elevation, the medicine fluid leaked outside the cap. Not a lot, but enough to make the whole bottle sticky. Leaking occured again when returning to sea level.I can imagine that this thing ""explode"" if taken on the plane with rapid rise or descent.Once there is an incident of leaking, tunring the bottle upside down, where the flat cap is down and stood on, the liquide leaks out (over 24 hours) where a bare hand can feel the liquid around the cap.I'm sure this bottle will work better with thicker fluids (e.g., shampoo), but then again, some reviewers expressed the opposite.I must say, it looks great. But in this case, function over style.I can't comment on the chemical reactions, but after reading other reviews, I might not want to take a chance of having this bottle holding any liquid medicines.",2,Stylish but leaking under pressure,1378339200,"09 05, 2013"

Here's why:1.  Most squeeze bottles have a small opening.  This has a very wide opening, making it easy to fill.2.  Most squeeze bottles are made of a fairly rigid plastic materials with sharp angles at the corners and base, making it very hard to squeeze the last bits of liquid out.  This is a completely rounded, ultra-soft (but strong and durable) silicone body that is very easy to squeeze.3.  Most squeeze bottles have a simple opening at the top, making it hard to control pour flow and hard to prevent spills/drips.  This has one of those newfangled ""bubble"" openings like on the new types of ketchup bottles:  easy to control and no messes.I have four of them now, and I have been using them *daily* for almost two years (purchased on Amazon last Spring).  I have a 1.25 oz bottle for hand sanitizer (and I literally use it multiple times each day).  I also have three 3 oz bottles for travel (shampoo, soap, and laundry soap).  All of them perform fantastically.  Cleaning is a breeze:  they easily come apart into three pieces (the body, ring, and cap), just rinse with hot water and let dry.

I think the Humangear GoToob is a pretty good product and I think that the designers are definitely on the right track.  As an experienced traveler, I've put a lot of thought and effort into searching for something of similar design.The GoToob has a nice small grippable shape, is TSA compliant (under 3oz volume), is squeezable to access all the contents and to squeeze out airspace (for pressure changes), is readily refillable, is clear so it's contents/remaining contents can be seen, is colour coded so the contents are identifiable, has a nicely one-hand deployable cap, has a cap aperture with a nifty leak-proof valve, and has a neat little suction cup built in so that it can be attached to smooth surfaces.The problem is the GoToob has at least one critical flaw (for which I subtracted a star), and, is kind of a very poor value for the money (for which I subtracted another star).  The problem with this product is the obvious ""weak point""... the thin plastic hinge joint on the cap. It will be the first thing that will break even with careful repeated use, just from ""plastic fatigue"".  It even looks weak/cheap.  Although the built in suction cup seems like a good idea, in actual use it is not universally practical.  It often fails leading to the GoToob landing on it's cap.  The cap is somewhat brittle plastic and is prone to cracking upon impact.These minor discrepancies would not be such an issue if the product were more modestly priced, or perhaps if the product came filled with something useful already, like hand sanitizer, shampoo or sunscreen.  But except for the uncommon silicone composition, this is NOT high tech rocket science we're talking about.  It's just a small waterproof bottle... period.  I suppose if you are wealthy and money is no object, or if some government agency is footing the bill, then heck, by all means, go ahead and buy these pricey mini-bottles.  But for the normal consumer, I just ask you to stop and consider.  Like, a TSA-compliant brand-named bottle of shampoo (filled with actual shampoo!) costs... what?  99 cents at a supermarket?  or FREE from a hotel?

Note that I'd link you the PM2 on Amazon, but they are so backlogged with orders, they cannot keep up.

Since the Sage 2 is barely lighter, and is equal to PM2 in many areas, the only reason to Sage over PM2 (in my opinion, and yours may differ) is for it's slightly smaller size in a tighter (eg blue jeans) pocket. Sure, the Sage is Ti and has the Chris Reeves style framelock, and if that's your bag, then spring for it.  But, for shear brute force cutting power, thin and lightweight for size, it's hard to beat the G-10 handled Paramilitary 2. There's a reason the PM2 is sold out frequently--it's amazing weight for size and price point.  Of course, for just EDC, there are even better and less expensive choices than the Sage 2 (e.g Dragonfly 2).  And, for the price of the Sage alone, one could buy the Paramilitary 2 AND the Dragonfly 2!A caution about the Sage 2: the Ti framelock may wear over time due to the softness of the Ti compared to other handle material.  For instance, in the Spyderco Military Ti, which has the same framelock as this Sage, Spyderco added on v.2.0 a steel liner to the Ti framelock due to wear and eventual play.  Not seen in the Sage as of this writing.Sage 2 is good.  It's perhaps dollar for dollar better than the Reeves Sebenza (notice I said dollar for dollar).

It can be taken down and put back together very quickly for when you get it really dirty. Given its flow-through design and lack of liners you can very easily clean it without taking it apart at all - water, canned air, and some gun oil will handle most of the cleaning jobs you'll encounter with this knife.Of course, the lack of backspacer and liners require the lock to be build out of one of the titanium handle slabs. So what you get is a Chris Reeve integral lock - a fat piece of ergonomically contoured titanium holding the blade in place in both the open and closed positions. Now that's rock solid. It's so solid you can immediately see and feel the difference when you open the knife for the first time, and for every time thereafter.With the signature Spyderco look and feel, you get totally intuitive deployment and grip with full assurance of handle retention.Put this all together and you get a knife beyond what Spyderco has ever done and on par with knives made with identical materials that run several hundred dollars more.

Moving my finger to the right isn't very likely (squeezing tighter forces it to the left), but it's conceivable that if the blade encountered very hard resistenence, the hand may make an errant motion, and disengage the lock.  So I wouldn't recommend it for EDC usage (whereas the Sage 1 is a great EDC)...this is really more of a functional showpiece/collectiable.I ordered a second one as a gift (made earlier, in 2010), and it felt quite different out of the box.  Lubricating the ball path with some Hoppes gun oil eventually took away the grittiness during deployment.  The actual frame lock goes ""in"" farther, and makes contact with more of the blade, so it's much more difficult for me to ""accidently"" disengage the lock, which was a good thing.  The problem here was the blade went off center after perhaps 100 openings (combination of full open via thumb, and half open via thumb > flick).  No big deal I thought, I'll just apply some Loctite and retension via the pivot screw, but I could never get it to stay centered after more than a dozen subsequent test openings.When you're holding this in your hand, it's hard to not think it's an amazing knife, but for functional use, the Sage 1 is a much better buy (lower cost, more durable handle coatings, no accidental disengagements, etc.Spyderco knives typically have very good fit/finish, and Amazon's return policy is great, so if you want a cool knife, I say go for it...but only if you already have the Sage 1.",4,So cool you may be afraid to use it,1322956800,"12 4, 2011"

A27EE7X7L29UMU,B002DUZL3G,ZapNZs,"[5, 5]","My review is going to be a little more specific than others given there are many great reviews already so I want to cover just a few specific areas for those who are comparing the Sage Ti to other ti folders, including the Chris Reeve Sebenza.Where's it made at?...First off, I want to say that just because this knife is not 100% US-made, I would not let this change your purchase intentions. Spyderco is an American company and the steel is produced in the US. The overseas assembly means nothing relative to the quality...this is as good as any Spyderco folder made to date, and this purchase supports an American company, American workers, and skilled knifemakers. This folder is higher quality than many custom folders. For the money, you will not find anything better suited for daily carry.Fit and finish...it is immaculate! I own multiple Chris Reeve Sebenzas and I love them...the Sage Ti has a fit and finish that is almost as good, and for half the price. I think every knife nut should own a Sebenza, but I think a Sage Ti is something everyone needs as well. For the person who likes the Seb but just can't swallow the price, the Sage Ti will leave you very satisfied.A ""legit"" Sebenza heritage...As you can see, this knife borrows heavily from the Sebenza, using the titanium frame lock (technically the ""Reeve Integral Lock"" first seen on the Sebenza about 25 years ago), and CPM-S30V steel, also made by Mr. Reeve with Crucible. Spyderco did this right...they got permission from Mr. Reeve, and they pay Chris Reeve Knives for usage of the patent. Spyderco has a strong track record of paying for patents rather than copying them without permission. So this knife is not a ripped off copy, but a unique and genuine design using solid features first fielded on the Sebenza (which is arguably the benchmark of all folding knives), but it also combines some of the characteristic Spyderco features such as the hole, full flat grind, spine jimping, great ergos, and leaflet blade. The flat grind and leaflet blade are incredibly useful for all sorts of different types of work and the flat grind has really become a Spyderco classic. The Ti Sage also incorporates better ergonomics on the handle than all other ti folders to date, including the Seb. So it isn't just a copy of the Sebenza, but Spyderco's take on the knife that Mr. Reeve pioneered with some Spyderco attitude in the center.Function...like the Sebenza, the knife is made for one thing and one thing only...lightweight performance. Like the plain Sebenza, it's pretty but in a functional sense from its simplicity. Weight-savings, handle thickness reduction, and strength are the driving forces behind this knife and they are more important than anything else, including cosmetic add-ons. Mr. Reeve and Mr. Glesser have both noted that they want to make the knife that goes in your pocket, not your case. The Sage Ti is just THAT knife. There are some great super strong knives on the market but they are HEAVY and BULKY and consequently have limited practicality...the use of titanium and making the lock as part of the handle reduces weight and thickness of the handle. It carries easily because of this and it is the knife that works well regardless of what you are wearing. The clip is also super easy on dress slacks. It's nice PC size for usage around non-knife people, and it's shape is non-threatening. And yet, you can use it for heavy usage and it will be able to handle quite a lot of abuse. The Reeve Integral Lock is not only incredibly strong, but it also does not fail when exposed to elements like sand that can cause even the strongest of locks to fail when gunked up...the lock's simplicity is its reliability. It's simplicity means you can also completely detail strip it, clean it, and reassemble it in less than the time it takes to smoke a cig.The Cliff Notes version of the above four paragraphs is that I am saying the Sage Ti carries an overall build quality not far away from the Chris Reeve Sebenza. The Sebenza is arguably the industry standard of the perfect folding knife. Most folding knives fall way short of even being capable of being compared to the Sebenza. Because the Ti Sage can hold its own with the Sebenza and quality comparisons can be made between the two, that speaks mountains as to how good this knife really is. I own over 200 mid-high-end knives, many which are custom. It outperforms virtually all other folding knives, and is very close to the quality class of the finest folding knife made. In the most basic terms, THE QUALITY OF THE Ti-SAGE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!The Ti Sage is simple, plain, incredibly light, has a great clip, incredible steel, super strong lock, and great blade geometry. So are you looking for a light, strong, quality knife you can carry every day for a good price? If so, this should be at the top of your list because it is not only one of the best bargains, but it is also one of the best folding knives made regardless of price and it outperforms many other knives that cost significantly more money..",5,This knife is exceptional and a great value...I think it is one of the best folding knives produced today.

A shame the seat post is so short. I also exceed the weight limit by 9 pounds at the moment. I was surprised when I weighed myself today before beginning my journey using this bike. It is not groaning and I should work off the extra 9 fairly quick. The cold and wet is what stopped me from using a regular bicycle, so I have no issues with the seat, other than the post is too short. I use a cruiser and a mountain bike, so this wide seat is fine for me. Since I can do 4 to 6 hours on a mountain bike (resting when I need to) I will say this seat is luxurious. But if you are not an avid biker, be happy getting something softer. I am not sure about the calorie counter, is it smart enough to know what amount of tension I adjusted it to? I must have hit what I like because I average 10.5 to 12.5 MPH, just like on my cruiser for a two hour period.Here is something that will help - I can wear a 34 or 36 inch length pair of pants. 34 is jsut a tad short and 36 is too long. Getting my leg only 3/4 straight when pedaling. The top of the pedal at its lowest point to the top of the seat is 26.5 inches. I could use another 8 inches on the seat post!New measurements - pedal at the same angle as the seat post on the highest setting comes out to about 27.5 inches. My mountain bike is set at 36. Makes a big difference in how far I can extend my leg.Just did two sessions of 30 minutes each and the seat is fine for me. Not sure how I can add 8 to 9 inches to the seat post. It would cause me to stoop over for the handlebars and would be more like the mountain bike.

(Ex. Yellow and Green look the same externally, other than color, yet the blue resistance in between them is larger diameter than either.)

A1E1CC7Y06D6LT,B002LSVL70,Eric J. Olson,"[1, 1]","Purchased this helmet based upon the recommendation of my bike shop rep.  I didn't like the colors of the Giro Venti helmets in the store so I purchased one in Black at Amazon.  The bike shop fitted me for a helmet and it felt natural from the start, so I knew that this was the right model for me.  Here are the pros and cons:PROS:1)I have a big head, so this helmet satisfies a nice fit that is fully adjustable - the adjustable click-band located inside the helmet created the perfect fit.2)The Giro Venti is lightweight and very well vented.3)Under $40 (with free shipping from amazon).4)Fits and looks great - Very adjustable and it looks great in black.5)Includes extra padding to insert within the helmet for a more comfortable/custom comfort level.6)Felt like a full fit, and did not sit on top of my head like other helmets. This helmet covers the sides of your head nicely.CONS:1)Foam molding inside of the helmet was lightweight, but dented easily (especially when placing the helmet down during rest).  Foam was similar in appearance to the same type used in foam coolers.Overall, a comfortable and decent helmet for the weekend (and after work) warrior who wants something to protect their big head.  I mostly liked that it was very adjustable and covered my entire head very well without sitting on top of my head (like other helmets).  The Giro Venti wrapped around my big head and has been very comfortable so far.

A3FGABY6YIHW1X,B002LSVL70,"P. Arnote ""parnote""","[0, 0]","I've gone through several bike helmets. Because I have a larger-than-average head, I've found it difficult to find a helmet that fits me properly ... at least at Walmart, Target and the other department store mass merchandisers. Every time I bought a new helmet, it was because the one I purchased previously didn't fit properly. They either rubbed a sore into my forehead (no room to add any padding, since the helmet was adjusted as large as it would go), or it squeezed my head and gave me a headache (again, adjusted to the largest size) half way through my planned bike ride. In either case, it made my bike rides less enjoyable than they should be.My previous helmet was a cheap, $20 Bell helmet that I found at Walmart. It had a simple elastic band in the back for ""automatic"" size adjustment. It actually fit my big head! And comfortably! So, I have been using that helmet for much of the past year. Because the Bell only has 10-12 smallish air vents, though, every time I'd go for a ride, my head would be just soaked in sweat. Plus, I worried about how much protection I'm actually getting from a cheap Bell helmet with a glued on plastic shell and a simple elastic band providing the overall ""fit."" (I'm aware that Bell makes some really fine helmets ... it's just that this one isn't one of them.) Still, I continued to use it for the simple reason that it fits my big head.Tiring of constantly looking like I just stepped out of the shower at the end of a bike ride, I started looking for a bike helmet with better ventilation that would fit me. I stumbled across this, the Giro Venti. Having been burned in the past with poorly fitting helmets, I cautiously proceeded with purchasing this helmet. My purchase was mostly based on the reviews from other big-heads who had purchased this helmet.Not only does the Venti fit me perfectly, but there's actually room to spare in the adjusting wheel in the rear of the helmet! Amazing, just by itself! Once I put the helmet on, I wore it around the house for a while, just so I could make small adjustments as needed to zero in the overall fit. Almost immediately, I noticed that the Venti's 20 vents were actually keeping my head cool! I could feel the air flowing through the vents, through my hair, and over my head as I walked around the house.The real test came a day or so later, when me and my wife went on a 22.5 mile bike ride on a local trail. At the end of that ride, I took off my helmet. Surprisingly, most of my head was DRY! Only the back of my head was sweating (as it should, since the heat is typically eliminated from a bike helmet out the back), but even then, it was nothing even close to how much my head would sweat with the cheapo Bell helmet. And, since my head was cooler, the rest of me also felt cooler.So, if you're a big-headed bike rider (like me) ... do yourself a favor and get this bike helmet! You'll not find a helmet that fits your melon-head as well for as good of a price ($30). The closest I have found since is a $45 Bontrager Omni at the local bike shop (which fits me quite well, too).Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this helmet. I'm thinking about keeping the Bell helmet around for using during rides in cooler temps ... like those in the late fall and winter.",5,WOW! What a difference!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012"

And when I wear a winter cap under it, the helmet only just barely fits, and is pretty tight.

AEJAGHLC675A7,B002MD01DE,John Williamson,"[25, 25]","Sometimes one finds a small gadget that may seem unworthy of reviewing, but it's so handy that it's worth coming back for more. ThisNite Ize Double Gated Carabineris just such a product.First discovered these in a camera store a few years ago, and they looked interesting enough to make get my first ones. I'm glad that I did, as they were my first, and since then I've purchased a number of them for various purposes, including here on Amazon when I saw them appear here. Since then I've bought a number of them, and have used these gadgets to attach a tripod to my photo backpack for quick release, for attaching items to a rack on the back of my mountain bike, as a replacement for the almost useless carabiner on water bottle lids, and as a handy belt-loop clip for temporary devices. The uses for these are only limited to your imagination.The S-Biner is a small, handy thing that is a sort of double-ended carabiner, constructed from ""durable glass-filled nylon with 202 Stainless Steel wire gates"" according to the manufacturer, and there are stainless steel versions, too. The hooks are slim and handy enough to use to attach to a variety of items, and if you don't like the black version, they make them in colors as well. The steel ones are constructed from ""2Cr13 Stainless steel for the body and 202 Stainless steel for the wire gates"" according to the manufacturer, and they're available in black, stainless or ""spectrum"" (multicolored) finish.It's hard to figure out what size might meet your needs, as I found out when trying to ordering a couple of these. As a result I went to the manufacturer's site and pulled down what is available, and will try to summarize here:Nylon (plastic) versions:*Size #0, plastic - dimensions: 1.18"" x .49"" x .14"", no weight rating.*Size #2, plastic - dimensions: 2"" x 1"" x .3"" weight rating: 10 lb.*Size #4, plastic - dimensions: 3.5"" x 1.5"" x .3"" weight rating: 25 lb.Stainless steel versions:*Size #1- dimensions: 1.56"" x .56"" weight rating: 5 lb.*Size #2- dimensions: 2"" x .88"" weight rating: 10 lb.* Size #3 - dimensions: 2.63"" x 1.13"" weight rating: 25 lb.*Size #4- dimensions: 3.5"" x 1.5"" weight rating: 75 lb.* Size #5 - dimensions: 4.38"" x 1.94"" weight rating: 100 lb.They also offer a handyS-Biner Ahhh Carabiner Clip Bottle Opener, which is a double-ended gadget list like the regular S-biner gadgets except that it has a built-in bottle opener, and from first hand experience, it's good. There are a number of other innovative versions and styles, including a handyNite Ize KeyRack Key Holder with S-Biners, with a stainless steel carabiner clip holding six different colored plastic S-Biners, and sized to hold 6 separate keys. Have that one in my camera bag most of the time.The packages warns that none of these, plastic or stainless, should be use for climbing or where ""disengagement could result in bodily injury or property damage."" Enough on that, but just let common sense prevail. On a personal note, just be sure that the gate spring properly engaged with the hook and you should have no problems. I've had no failures on mine. You could probably just use a garden-variety cheap aluminum carabiner as a substitute for these, but if you value your gear, these are well worth a look. Might suggest that if you're going to use them where they will result in metal-to-metal contact, the plastic versions might be a better choice. Have use both the #2 and #4 sizes with cycling and for photo use as noted above and so far they have held up admirably.After having bought a number of these both for personal use and as gifts for those who already seem to have everything, can only become one of the handiest gadgets that I've owned.

The paint has NOT chipped or flaked off... it's acquired a few dents along the way but all in all it's an excellent bottle.---I've owned a lot of different brands of water bottles over the years. Quite a few have been Sigg aluminum water bottles. I've discontinued using those because the coating which is applied to the inside of the bottle has tended to flake off in time thus offering no protection from the aluminum. And I believe the coating may contain BPA which is not desirable.The Hydro Flask has a lot of things going for it. It's made of high grade stainless steel so you don't have to worry about anything leeching into the water from the bottle itself. Nor do you have to worry about inside coatings flaking off.This particular bottle is double-walled which means it can hold both cold and hot liquid and keep it that way for many hours. If I put a few ice cubes in with my cold water in the morning, that water will still be cold the next day... not room temperature like in a single-walled bottle. And hot beverages, like coffee, will stay really hot for at least 4 hours and drinkably hot for several hours after that.You still don't want to put carbonated beverages into this though... the carbonation could cause the cap to leak or worse.The double-wall construction also eliminates the problem of the outside of the bottle sweating. Sweating isn't necessarily the end of the world, but if you put in cold liquid on a hot, humid day, sweating will occur with a single-walled bottle and the resulting condensation will drip on things or get clothes wet if you've got the bottle in a pack or suitcase... so double-walled bottles are advantageous in that regard.The cap has a generous silicone O-ring which does not leak. The cap screws in easily and seals completely. There is also a sports cap available if you prefer those. I was not able to locate a sports cap in the store where I purchased my Hydro Flask, but was pleased to discover that the Kleen Kanteen sports cap fit the Hydro Flask perfectly.It's cool that the Hydro Flask is available in so many colors but I do wonder if in time the paint may chip off? I have not had that occur yet on my bottle, but I have read some other people discussing that issue. If that is a concern of yours then you may want to consider getting just the plain stainless steel bottle that has no paint at all on it.The Hydro Flask is really well made. The lip of the bottle is nicely rounded and does not feel sharp in any way on your lips as you are drinking out of it. My SIGG bottle has sharp threads that I can feel when I drink out of it and that has always bothered me.The standard width of this bottle is large enough for me to slip in ice cubes and there is also a wide mouth version available. You can wash this in a dishwasher. If you put coffee or tea in it, eventually you'll get that grungy looking coffee or tea stain which can be removed with coffee pot cleaner like Urnex Carfiza, for instance:Urnex Cafiza, 20oz powder. A bottle brush helps keep the bottle clean as well.All things considered I think this is about as good as a water bottle can get.",5,Great quality. Durable.

A3LSZYR80H6FIS,B002ZKXJ2E,Poopbagger,"[0, 0]","I've been researching and preparing myself before I begin traveling A LOT! So naturally, I wanted a reliable water bottle. My research led me to the Hydro Flask. I've exclusively drank out of this bottle for over two weeks. Here's my thoughts:Does it ""bleed""? NOPE! Never, not at all, even if you tried--even if you splashed water on it, water slicks off easily.Does it retain temperature? It keeps cold drinks very cold for a long time, though the amount of ice you put into your drink has more of an effect on how LONG everything stays cold, so keep that in mind. The bottle is not magic, highly impressive though. More ice, longer it'll stay cold, is what I've found, so don't expect one cube of ice will last you all day.Does it leak? No, the cap is very high quality, it makes me feel cool every time I twist it off.Final thoughts? It's a great bottle, I've never owned premium quality bottles before, but I always research my purchases, when I can. I'm not exactly sure if you can use this bottle to boil water with, I think it won't be effective and would just damage the bottle since there's a layer of insulator in between the layers of stainless steel, though, I think I would have a different set of gear if I was more interested in camping/hiking rather than traveling from city to city.Thank you for reading my review and hope this is also the bottle for you. :)",5,After a couple weeks of using it.,1349395200,"10 5, 2012"
A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B002ZKXJ2E,Stephen M. Charme,"[1, 1]","I am a serious runner and over the years have tried countless different water bottles and carriers in an effort to make sure I have a cold drink when I need it, especially in very warm weather (though even running in the dead of winter I still sweat and run with a water bottle). This product has mostly five star ratings for a reason: It works great. Here is why I like it.1. For me this bottle is not noticeably heavier than an uninsulated plastic bottle or squeeze bottle. It easily fits into the different water carriers that I  use (Nathan Quickdraw, Amphipod Full Tilt Velocity and Eastern Mountain Espresso). I have no trouble running when this is completely full, and when it is empty I don't notice it at all.2. This has no metallic smell or taste, so when I drink the G2 Gatorade that I fill it with my drink tastes fine. The cap is easy to unscrew and screw back on multiple times during my runs, and the narrow mouth makes this as easy to drink from as the plastic bottle that my G2 comes in.3. Unlike a thermos bottle this has no glass that can break if you drop it. Yet it insulates just as well. The first time I went running with this I put in my usual 10 ice cubes because with my uninsulated steel water bottle that I had been using, the ice cubes were necessary to keep my drink cold during my run and would usually be melted with forty five minutes. [Note: Because this has a narrow mouth, the ice cubes from an automatic ice cube maker in a refrigerator will easily fit into this, but the larger ice cubes from ice cube trays will not unless you first make them smaller by running them under hot water.]The first thing I noticed during my run was that the bottle did not feel cold at all like my uninsulated steel bottle. That told me that the insulation really worked, as did the fact that my drink was nice and cold during my entire run. And when I finished my run an hour and a half later, the ten ice cubes that I had put in were still intact! Actually I had counted on them melting to provide me with extra liquid, so in the future I'll probably skip putting any in or just put in a couple.4. The stainless steel version looks sharp and is well made. The top did not leak at all during a vigorous run.5. This also fits perfectly into the water bottle carrier on my bicycle.Bottom line: This is my new water bottle for running and bike riding. The rest are now gathering dust on my shelf. I highly recommend this.I also ordered a sports cap for $3.99 directly from the company (the sellers on Amazon were charging excessively high prices for shipping), not because it is difficult to unscrew the top and drink directly from the bottle, but simply because I like a sports cap.Update June 13, 2012: I liked this so much that I ordered a second one for my wife to use when we go bike riding, and for me to use as a second water bottle on my 10+ mile runs.",5,Excellent water bottle,1339200000,"06 09, 2012"

This unit held up beautifully under all conditions.  It went up pretty easy, for two people it took us 26 minutes from beginning to end (thats also including the guy lines).  The size was perfect, with the straight walls we were able to put in a large 7-1/2 ft picnic table with oversized benches, and had plenty of room to put a table up for the stove.  We also stored (3) large 28 gal. containers, a 58 gal. cooler, an oversized tackle box, and a 18 gal. container (all of which were not stacked), and still had room to move.While we were there, many other campers drove by remarking how good it looked and couldn't believe the size.  After and during the storm, campers were very impressed how durable it was and wanted to know where they could get this unit.  We actually let other campers seek shelter there during the storm, and they couldn't believe that there wasn't one leak (many were amazed).My husband and I went through several screenhouses trying to find one that actually worked well, but we tried to stay under $100, needless to say we got our monies worth.  I should have gone with Coleman in the beginning and paid a little more, it would have made several other camping trips more enjoyable.  I would recommend this unit to anyone that likes to camp without being bothered by the bugs, and weather.

A29ZEV20RCXV1D,B003C6TZ1E,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[173, 188]","I no doubt aroused some interest in my comment by the phrase ""... but be informed... "" but I make the comment because while there is great information out there on the internet concerning air rifles per se, alas, there is also a great deal of MIS-information. For example, if you order this rifle, LOOK at the barrel on the top side of the rifle and you should see the following: ""Gamo Big Cat .. Velocity 950 FPS [Feet Per Second] with PBA [Performance Ballistic Alloy] Platinum"" [sic]. 'Some' [please note my qualifying that!] folks who order this rifle immediately think they have been sent the wrong rifle because they expected to see something like ""1200 FPS"" because often enough the Gamo folks who make the ""Big Cat"" will show the wordage ""Big Cat 1200"" but this refers to the .177 caliber model and NOT the .22 caliber model which [the .22 caliber] generally have 'lower' FPS ratings than the .177 caliber models. However, the take-down or knock-down capability of the bigger .22 caliber pellet within 40 yards is greater than the .177 caliber.I suppose another reason for my comment is one individual in another forum literally ridiculing [!] other posters making the claim on the now classic debate ""what is the best caliber for hunting [including pest control] squirrels?"" [sic] and this person opines, ""... what a stupid question because the higher the FPS, the more velocity you have and that is the name of the game so the .177 is the only way to go ... ."" The ballistics literature on pellets [.177/20 cal/22 cal/25 cal pellets] written by those folks who 'know' what they are talking about would highly disagree! There are various 'other' factors to consider besides FPS ratings! And this too which you can readily verify yourself -- for every writer 'X' who says ""this is the 'only' way to go"", you will find writer 'Y' and perhaps just as qualified who says the direct opposite and, get this, writer 'Z' who comes along and claims that both 'X' and 'Y' are 'both' wrong! In effect, opinions vary 'sooooooo' widely that the bottom line becomes one's own individual experience and what works best for them.Having said that and speaking only for myself, I find the .22 caliber pellet best for what I term a ""clean kill"" and for sheer knock-down [and stay-down] power so that the target is humanely dispatched with one shot and does not suffer. I'll also qualify that too: Personally, I am not interested in long yardage shots for the 'sport' of it but rather short yardage [from the target] pest control of squirrels and gophers who do quite a bit of property damage in my own rural area what with digging holes, chewing on antenna feed [satellite TV wiring, amateur radio cable, etc.] wires, getting into the attic or literally chewing their way into the basement, chewing up fabric outside seat cushions, spending hours [both grey and so-called 'red' squirrels] attempting to gain entry into so-termed ""squirrel-proof"" and high mounted bird feeders, squirrel droppings, garden feasting and flower nibbling, etc. . Finally this: even with the .22 caliber pellet, there are various types and kinds of pellets and I strongly recommend reviewing the existing [but trusted website] literature on the matter. Further still, for those who do prefer the .177 caliber over the .22 caliber and for whatever reason(s) insist on highest velocity FPS ratings, once you get a pellet that approaches the sound-barrier, the air rifle will fully 'mimmick' a .22 caliber rim-fire bullet 'sound' wise and this, especially if neighbors live close by, could result in the neighbors believing you're firing 'bullets' out there versus pellets [although common sense dictates that both are just as dangerous!] and suddenly the police show up to investigate what neighbors may report to them as ""gun shots."" Now me, and in a very rural area, this is not a problem but then too I use pellets [and caliber therein] at or slightly below below the 1000 FPS level and if I do use the PBA [.22 but faster and 'louder' sounding 'pointed' pellets], well, my second air rifle was/is the Gamo 'Whisper' rifle [** has end of barrel 'sound baffles' to greatly mute the sound] although even there I opted for the .22 caliber versioin versus the .177 caliber version. For me, the .22 pellet does the job and short-range 'humanely' so. And yes, I do own .177 rifles and while they are in fact entirely capable of being used for pest control or hunting small game [** Note that I did 'not' dispute that!], I use the .177 primarily for sport paper target shooting [both indoor in my basement and outdoor with non-living 'mechanical' targets using a BB/pellet trap box] while using the physically larger .22 air rifle caliber pellet in a .22 caliber air rifle for squirrel/gopher pest control ... and even then, only when necessary.I've found the Gamo 'Big Cat' .22 caliber air rifle [** and I also have the Gamo 'Whisper' .22 air rifle] to be an excellent ""break-barrel"" air rifle delivering enough punch with its .22 caliber pellet to do the job, and humanely so, the 'first' time around. The only other comment I would make is that the user should take the time to 'properly' sight-in their air rifle scope and here too there are various websites that offer tutorials on how best to do this.Doc Tony",5,An excellent rifle with excellent results ... but be informed!,1297468800,"02 12, 2011"

While it is no competition air gun, it certainly has enough accuracy to take down squirrels at 50 yards.  Cocking is smooth and the trigger isn't 'bad' as it is just different.  Took about 100-150 rounds to really break in but is still going strong after almost 1000.The biggest problem with this rifle is the scope/rings that come with it.  I highly recommend replacing them both.  I have a Tasco 3-9x40 ($40 at Wal-Mart) and a solid, one piece scope mount.  I have never lost zero.  Other than that, there isn't really anything wrong with the gun that I can think of.  The noise level is very reasonable (sounds like a spring airsoft sniper), which was my primary reason for choosing 22 over 177.  And no, there aren't iron sights on this gun.Highly recommended as a first air rifle or a suburban pest control rifle.Update: 1200+ roundsPower level has been slowly weakening to the point where the impacts are out of my scope's elevation adjustment.

After a full shower and drying wet hair, I would estimate dry time around 2-3 hours in still, 72deg air).However, the first time I washed it, I seemed to have lost some of it's magic.

I purchased this pistol to prep myself for the real thing and hopefully protect my house if needed. The wife doesn't want a real gun and didn't want this one either but I convinved her it was better than a baseball bat... anyways... when I opened the gun I was surprised at the weight and feel of the gun. In the hands it feels like a real gun (which I have held) I loaded it up with some pellets and co2 and fired away. The blowback feature is a nice touch to apparently simulate a real pistol. I ordered the extra magazines and in less than a10 minutes unloaded them all. This gun Is a blast to shoot and im assuming great practice for the real thing. I was shoooting into the crosman trap target and am currently working on my accuracy. As other have mentioned you can get about 3 solid 16 round magazines before noticing some falloff. After that the co2 cartridge needs replacing. They say that the blowback feature uses some co2 which might explain how little actual shooting is allowed per cartridge. I say who cares this thing is such a blast to shoot its worth it ( with the right ammo) the combination of weight feel and features made me happy I bought this.

Its got a nice weight to it (weighs about as much as a Glock 17) and the blowback feature... wow! The recoil makes it feel like a real firearm.  Of course the recoil is not as powerful as a 9mm. Probably a little bit less than a 22 ruger pistol; however, it works as advertised and you can definitely feel the recoil and the slide blows back and cocks the hammer.  The downside to the blowback feature is it uses up CO2 at a much faster rate.  I can probably only get half the number of shots off this pistol (about 30) that I could with my similarly powered Crosman 1008. The other thing that is missing from this gun is after the last shot is fired, the slide does not stay locked open.  The pistol is very accurate from 20'.  The iron sights are complete garbage and are non adjustable. The other problem with the sights are they move position with every shot due to the slight deviation of the barrel and slide with each shot, so if you rely on the iron sights, you'll be shooting all over the place. I would have rated this gun 5 stars had it not been for the really terrible sights.  I fixed this problem by getting a cheap laser sight and attaching it to the rail on the botton of the gun and now I am able to shoot very accurately and not rely on the terrible sights.

CO2 usage for a blowback seem to be average.Now for the bad, First I want to mention that the safety level is awkward and is located on the right side of the frame, The left lever is just molded in (I hate that, Why even mold it in?!) the trigger is expectably heavy in double action which I estimate around 10lbs or so but the single action is mode is pretty good, Do note that the trigger does not have a short reset so you will have to release the trigger and pull it again every time which is annoying, The magazine has been unreliable for me and only feeds when it wants to.My biggest gripe with this pistol is the COMPLETE LACK OF ACCURACY! I have shot many BB pistols and airsoft pistols which shoot better than this! Shame on you Gamo! I also would've preferred a longer sight radius and the sights them selves are rather odd. The power of the pistol is a bit lacking as well, I would've liked to have seen it around 450-550 with lead pellets in lieu of longer CO2 life so it actually might be able to take down small game.

I figured after one clip of 16 pellets the accuracy noticeably degrading. One maybe be able to squeeze another 8 rounds.  I bought the xtra clips , but I could have spared the expense. The gun is nice and heavy , similar to a real firearm and the blow back is comparable to maybe a .22 caliber semi auto pistol of any brand. I like it. My oldest daughter is purchasing one for home defense. Keep in mind that on all Co2 air guns to put a drop of the pellgun oil on top the cartridge where it will be punctured...I have left cartridges in for weeks and it seems there has been minimal if any leakage at all while in storage.I would like to add to this review to mention that I had done some more testing. First thing that I did was to lubricate every moving part on this gun....including the pellet wheels. Lubricating them started giving me more consistent performance of the pellets firing. I highly recommend only using Gammo brand pellets..Match, Hunter and Master Point or the alloys...they fit tighter than the Gammo Magnums. The skirts seem to be a tad larger than Crosman or Daisy which helps in sealing the pellet chamber and to keep the pellet from moving forward or backwards keeping wheel from advancing. Along with lubricating the gun itself(especially the slide) I also put a dab of oil directly in front of the pellets while in the pellet wheel. DOing these simple things I feel has improved the performance of the gun. Waiting a minute or so while switching magazines or flipping ends also will net the Co2 cartridge warming up. I managed to get 64 shots of various Gammo pellets on one C02 cartridge and then noticed a drop in performance. I was not going for accuracy at throwing lead at a piece of paper 50-60 feet away but more so to eliminate misfires on pellets. I have accomplished this. I would also like to add that if a pellet slides into the wheel past the entry edge, remove it and find one that is tighter. Save the loose fitting ones to shoot in one of your .177 pellet rifle(s).I used Hoppes gun oil..it has a small metal needle type extension good for getting into tight places. One could probably used WD-40 and get similar results.I hope this information helps for those who may not had good luck with their purchase.",5,guns,1370390400,"06 05, 2013"

There are a lot of reviews on this co2 gun already, so I will try to keep my review short.Pros:Looks niceGood weightBlowbackAccessory mountCons:Non-adjustable sights.  This is a HUGE design flawLow velocity and quick drop offLow shot count2 stage trigger pullLoading the magazinesPrice for what you getOk, so first off, the blowback is nice, but just to clarify,  the blowback of any pellet, bb, or airsoft gun is gonna be half or less of a 22lr.  This is not at fault of the pt-85, but needs to be clarified as some other reviews seem to make it out to be more dramatic.  With that said, I like the blowback on the gun better than other co2 pistols I have tried thus far.The single biggest flaw in the gun is the lack of adjustable sights.  If you are one of the lucky ones that happen to be dead on, more power to ya.  My pt 85 on the other hand shoots 4 to 6"" low at a measly 15 to 20'. And unless I wait a minute between shots, the canister freezes up and the shots fall even lower than that.  This is a pellet gun, I bought because I enjoy the pellets accuracy over steel bb's.  But I have cheap bb and airsoft guns that group better and on sight better than this thing.Which brings me to the magazine, not only is it cumbersome to load if u have big hands like me, its rotary nature means every trigger pull has a long pull to rotate the magazine.  Shot count is low, which is expected with blowback, but given the low velocity I would have expected a few more.  I get about 3 and a half magazines or 54 shots before co2 is too low to cycle the slide.To sum it up, I think in terms of blowback pistols, I would have been better spending the same amount or a tad more on a blowback bb gun, as the pellets in this case only make loading difficult and accuracy pointless with the fixed sights.",2,sub-par,1396137600,"03 30, 2014"

Yeah carbon steel is more maintenance than stainless but i like oiling my knifes and watching them shine so thats not an issue and as long as you can avoid rust, stains and patina show a well used knifes character.After receiving my 601 i was so pleased with the quality that i ordered the Mora Companion in the military green as well and am very happy with both knives. Mora sheaths and handles are functional if not attractive but the blades and grinds are great, neither of mine were what i would call shaving sharp but arrived sharper than most knives i have ordered.",5,Prob should have got the 612,1366416000,"04 20, 2013"
A1N2L6ZDSMS38T,B003Z5CTV0,"David E. Nagoda ""Love Fishing""","[0, 0]","I first bought a Mora knife, when I was a kid, way back in the 1950's.  It was a laminated blade that was very sharp and taught me to respect a sharp edge (the hard way).  I still have that knife!  I got this one because it had a similar look and a carbon blade that I wanted to check out, and, it was only $15!  Though this is not an expensive knife it is pretty well made, similar to my 55 year old original.  The blade came fairly sharp and with a bit of work and a stropping took a good sharp edge.  The wooden handle is painted red.  It is comfortable in the hand and I like the guard as I have the blade VERY sharp!In summary, a good product, it is basic and inexpensive so I won't worry about abusing it.  I like the blade a lot and I may just remove and replace the handle, which though adequate is uninspired.  Well worth the cost!",4,Good little knife for $15,1398816000,"04 30, 2014"

While the blade does look like a steak knife, it is a bit thicker than most steak knives and is very rigid. The spine is a bit rough. The rest of the blade is nicely polished.The handle fills the hand pretty well. The handle is too smooth for me to want to use the knife without a guard. The guard also makes the thing look a little less like a steak knife. I can understand why some might think that the handle isn't wood. It feels like wood to me, but it is extremely light.The sheath is quite functional. The knife is held securely. The top of the sheath comes halfway up the handle. There is no way to get a full grip before drawing the knife out. The easiest way seems to be to pull up on the guard and grab the handle as it comes out of the sheath. The worst thing is that the belt slot won't easily fit over a thick leather belt.Any negatives are outweighed by the excellent value. It's also nice to have a knife that isn't trying to look tacticool.",5,Excellent value,1361923200,"02 27, 2013"

It does not rust as easily as other carbon blades, but in turn does not accept bluing as well either.Very sharp out of the box, and even sharper once you touch it up with a stone.2. Finger GuardHaving the guard on both sides might be good for fighting or something, but as a utility knife, it makes many applications with the knife difficult or impossible. The rear guard is right where you would put a thumb to increase leverage on the blade. However, it will stop you from slipping your fingers onto the blade.3. The HandleGreat handle. Red Painted wood and oval shape make the handle attractive and easy to grip. However, lathe marks on the butt, as well as not being able to see how far into the knife the tang goes are inconvenient, but my no means deal breakers.4. The SheathThe only issue I have had with the sheath is the belt loops. They are trash and I cut them off my sheaths as they would deform and make the knife flop around. The sheath bit itself is not too shabby.

During the first month of using my camelbak i got so many mouthfuls of and and dirt that I realized how important this cover would be. I ordered the black cover because it was cheaper than the blue one, figure that out.. but was not disappointed at all. Shipping was fast and painless, and the product arrived on time. Install this little bugger is a bit of a challenge but i found that wetting the ergo hydrolock valve stem before trying to push the bite valve back on helped. Now that I have used this for a few months the only gripe I have with it is that the bite valve leaks slightly when the cover is closed. I think this is because the fit is so tight that it pinches it slightly, allowing some water to drip out. Simply turning off the yellow valve on the ergo hydrolock fixes this for me, but is a slight nuisance when biking. If your pack didn't come with a manual valve, definitely pick one of these up to to keep it from leaking [...]Over all I am very happy with this product and it has help up great ofter constant use.",5,"Does its job, and has held up well!",1313884800,"08 21, 2011"

I doubt the velocities of most BB guns will cause  much build up of any kind in a BB gun barrel, but I have noticed these zinc plated BB's seem to be more consistently round w/o any dimples, etc. That alone is a good reason.IMHO better BB's allow a cheap air gun to perform a little better & maybe last a little longer, and your more better air guns to operate as they should.",4,"Are Daisy ""Silver"" BB's worth a little more than copper BB's?",1387065600,"12 15, 2013"

I purchased this so that my sister could have a primary pistol-like spring weapon for our backyard battles. I wasn't expecting too much quality, but I thought that I might at least get a tiny bit of use out of it. I was wrong.The gun has terrible weight, feels like a tiny piece of plastic junk. Now on the other hand, I prefer my weapons to have a good weight to them, but that could just be me.The iron sights are terrible.The ""fold-out stock"" doesn't even lock into place when in its extended position. Worst of all, the magazine's top is so loose that the BB's just fall out if you even tilt it slightly to an angle. That being said when you insert the mag into the gun, if you aren't that strong,and try to pull the bolt at ANY angle, the BB's will fall into the hollow body of the gun. They cannot be removed except by keeping the bolt pulled back and shaking the gun at different angle to try and coax the BB's out of the magazine insertion slot, or disassembling the gun and taking them out.Now when I try to load it,the BB will fall out the barrel if it even enters the chamber at all. This gun is NOT worth it. Please don't be taken in by the dirt-cheap price and the fact that this weapon was featured in CoD Black Ops. Save a little bit more and get a better weapon.

AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B004DI5H26,pastapadre,"[2, 2]","SCEA's MLB series has arguably been the most consistent sports franchise this generation. There is a reason why baseball gamers have flocked to it, and it isn't just because the competition has struggled so mightily. For MLB 11: The Show the introduction of new analog controls represented the most significant shift for the somewhat risk-adverse series in years.STRENGTHS-ANALOG PITCHINGOf the new analog controls it is the pitching that is far and away the best. There is quite a bit of control given to the user in both location and velocity that can be determined based on the movement of the stick. It is more fun than the just pressing buttons on the meter while not going as far as to make each pitch a ""process"" to complete with the stick.-ROAD TO THE SHOWCheck out full detailed impressions of Road to the Show. The performance based system is an immense improvement over the goal based system of previous years. That on its own makes the mode much more enjoyable and worth spending time with, despite the nagging issues of slow load times and out-of-place commentary.-VISUALSThe graphics are simply stunning, with amazing stadium lighting, well represented player faces, and improved player models. The authentic broadcast cameras look great and add an additional challenge to pitching. The one glaring flaw comes with the lack of collision detection which just stands out more and more in such a detail-oriented game as the rest of the visuals advance.-GAMEPLAY AND AUTHENTICITYOnce again this is the area that The Show always nails and why it is so popular with hardcore baseball fans and not just fans of baseball gaming. Though MLB 11 just builds on what was already present that doesn't change the fact that it represents the sport beautifully. The gameplay experience is realistic and reliable and the flow of the games just feels right.WEAKNESSES-ONLINE PLAYThough marginally improved online remains a weakness of the series. Connections are completely hit or miss resulting in either smooth games or ones that are crippled by lag. Regardless pitchers have a distinct advantage over batters. Just check out the leaderboard where even the top players hit under .200 and average 17+ strikeouts a game. The insistence of guess pitch being on in quick matches and league participation being prevented for two weeks after buying the game remain head-scratchers. Some very welcome options were added this year but until the performance is ironed out and better design decisions are made the online play for the series will not meet today's standards.-ANALOG FIELDING/THROWINGWhile the analog based pitching system is a complete success, and the analog hitting more polarizing, the analog throwing system is where the changes to controls falls short. Errors are frequent and in many cases the outcomes don't make much sense. Safe throws can go off line inexplicably or display as though they were risky throws and there is really no explanation of why it happens or how to handle the system efficiently.-AUDIOThe commentary has quickly become very tired and bringing in Eric Karros for Rex Hudler was replacing one bad contributor with another. While baseball game soundtracks are typically my favorite of all the sports the soundtrack for MLB 11 is one of the worst in recent memory.-LOAD TIMESHaving plagued the series for this entire generation the slow loading times can be frustrating. This is no more evident than in Road to the Show mode where just as much time could spent loading as in-game playing. It could be that the mostly static loading screens make the waits feel even worse than they are.SUMMARYMLB 11: The Show is one of the few sports games these days that consumers can feel confident they know what they are getting when they buy it. The game will accurately represent the sport, have top notch visuals, and provide a full feature set. Unfortunately where the series has struggled has been consistent as well. The analog controls at the very least breathed some new life into the series, and going forward it will do well to improve on overall presentation and online performance.",4,Authenticity supreme but has some long-running issues,1325548800,"01 03, 2012"
A20MBUOT9S7AEP,B004DI5H26,Robert T.,"[3, 3]","Here's a really quick review. MLBTS11 uses the same formula as MLBTS10, with a just a few (but MAJOR) updates. Of course, we have purely analog options for hitting, pitching, and fielding. My personal preference is to use analog control for hitting (which makes hitting infinitely more possible but also more fun and intuitive/engaging) and pitching (which is more fun, but also more challenging than simple button pitching) while leaving the fielding option as button control only. To me, this makes the game 100% stronger than its immediate predecessor. They also modified some of the in-game physics so a baseball hitting the outfield wall doesn't go bouncing away like its made of rubber. There are still frustratingly slow field-to-throw transitions for fielders, but this is minor really. Some of the Cooperstown and Minor League options are no longer available (very limited selection of Minor League fields to play at), but again these are minor. My biggest complaint is that, like previous iterations, almost every game has this inexplicable feeling of predetermination to it...like the outcome is already set and the computer adjusts its own play to achieve said outcome. Whether this means the computer giving you too many opportunities to win or breaking out of a scoreless rut to hit 4 HRs in the 9th, I'm often left wondering whether (like pro wrestling) each match is fixed. Who knows. All in all, this is the game I'd hoped MLBTS10 would have been.",5,Few MAJOR changes make this the best one yet,1310256000,"07 10, 2011"

The color (red) is brilliant and deep and I feel like it made me visible to oncoming traffic on the back one lane road where I was riding.I usually go for a more snug fitting jersey and this (XL) is not that.  It is a very loose cut and a bit long.  When riding, it is very comfortable, even though it's loose.  When standing, it hangs way down in the back.  Usually my jersey pockets are at mid back level.  This one hangs around my butt.  So, if you like the snugger fit, go for a size smaller.

I purchased this device along withSimple Green 19128 Crystal Industrial Cleaner/Degreaser, 1 Gallon Bottleand a bottle of lube oil. I settled back to watch a couple of YouTube videos along with a VERY helpful video on Filzer's website.After adjusting the brakes, checking the tires, etc, it was time for the drive train. I used a bike trainer -Kinetic by Kurt Road Machine Indoor Bicycle Trainer- to hold the bike in place though I could have simply leaned it against the wall. After diluting the degreaser I began the chain cleaning process. The Filzer did an amazing job at getting the chain uber-clean. I took some extra time to clean off the easily accessible parts with a rag, applied some chain lube and called it a day.Everything runs so much more smoothly now. When it came time to empty out the Filzer I was disgusted by all the crap it had cleaned up. Moreover there was a huge glob of metal fragments clinging to the magnet at the bottom of the device.

I cleaned my chain with the Filzer for the first time, and as I marveled at the chain's cleanliness, glistening in the Florida sun, I could hear angels sing.  Women swooned. A cardinal perched on my shoulder and sang.Okay maybe not.  A cardinal did fly into my garage and I had to shoo it out so it wouldn't get trapped in there overnight.  However, I see no causal relationship between these events.Anyway. After a cursory glance of the existing reviews, I put a 50% Simple Green solution into the device (regular old $10 per gallonSimple Green, not the more expensivebike version), closed the lid around the bottom part of the chain, and spun it around for a minute or two.  Acting on the suggestion in another review, I then emptied the cleaner, refilled with water, and ran it through again.  That's all it took, and the chain was completely clear of any dirt, debris, or grease.  Once it was done, I couldn't believe that was it.  So uncomplicated.The unit is built with removable and replaceable components (available here:Filzer Chain Cleaner Spare Parts Kit) although it looks like it will be a while before anything like that is necessary. After a couple of chain cleanings, the wheels and brushes are still basically in perfect shape.There are questions regarding the cleaner's suitability for use with fixed-gear bikes.  It will work fine, since it doesn't require any slack in the chain to operate. The top half separates completely from the lower half, and you just rest the lower part of the chain (the section that moves toward the front of the bike when you're pedaling in reverse) on the wheels of the lower section, then place the top section over the chain, like a sandwich.

Also you can use it on single speed chains that dont have much deflection that is required with some other chain cleaner units.

Some use it (or buy an additional dedicated unit) to also rinse the chain after cleaning and/or to lube the chain.Dont forget to pre -clean the chain and drivetrain with a water hose to get most of the gunk and grime off and use a grunge brush to clean the derailleur pulleys, cassette cogs, and chainring(s).

It was always fairly loud when coasting, and I noticed that it always spun the cranks when I would walk the bike like it was a fixie and not a single speed. I just lived with it. After a little under a year, I started noticing that when I'd start from a stop it would slip. For a long time I thought it was a too loose chain, or that my chainline was off. I finally realized that it was actually the freewheel one day when I went to start from a stop and the cranks just spun around like I was pedaling backwards. I started playing around with it more and found that one of the pawls must have broken because about a 1/3 of the time I can cause the freewheel to completely disengage allowing the cranks to spin out. Needless to say this is very dangerous when I am trying to clip in and pedal uphill! It also corroded fairly early on even though I'd clean it off after riding in bad weather. I'd hoped for better, but I guess I got what I paid for. I definitely won't be buying again.I had read great reviews about this brand of freewheel, but I've been a little disappointed about it so far. It is pretty wide and causes me some trouble when I try to get the rear wheel into the bike. Also, it doesnt spin very freely. It tends to spin the crank arms if I don't hold them still when the rear wheel is spinning. I tried lubing it a bit, but it didn't seem to help much. It's not a bother when I'm on the bike because my feet hold the cranks still, but doing repairs on the stand, it is a bit annoying and disconcerting. It's also a lot louder than I expected. It's not as loud as the free hub on my wifes bike, but. It is still pretty noticeable.

Even once they look pretty dirty they do a good job of continuing to remove dirt, and the big clumps can be removed by wiping them through a rag allowing a single piece of ""floss"" to get most or all of a bike's bits clean.20 of these will last me at least a year so if the price stays around seven dollars I'll probably buy another pack when the last of my current pack are gone. However, I wouldn't call these things essential as you certainly can make do with shoelaces or cloth strips if you don't have a few dollars to spring on these. On the other hand, if you can't afford 14 bits once a year then you probably don't have a bike worth cleaning, anyway.I do wish they were thicker, or came in a second thicker width.

Since I wanted this kettle for camping, it will do the trick, but I might have to force myself to buy the Titan as well.",4,"Good, cheap option",1382313600,"10 21, 2013"

A2KJAPSBHFVNFE,B004N5WFII,AvidReader,"[6, 6]","I like to backpack, and when winter came I knew that boiling water from snow would be far more efficient than hiking to streams and lakes. So I began looking around. I went to many stores and played with what they had. I ended on the GSI Stainless Tea Kettle.Right off the bat I will tell you that it has great fit and finish. The bend at the top of the handle helps keep the pot stable hanging over a fire in high winds. Putting the spigot in line with the handle was a great idea, I can pour the water out by touching the handle only. Though as you reach the end of the pour, you do need to put a hand on the lid so it doesn't fall off(in the end it is still a solid lid which stays on very well). Heck even that little handle on the lid is designed to stay up so I can grab it easily to check the water inside.The other reviewer was wrong on the Oz, I tested with 3 different measuring pots I have in the kitchen, this really does hold 32oz. It's light weight and low profile.So why the 2 stars. Well simply put, it started warping after only one outing. The heat of the fire has started to warp the kettle after only 3 days of use. I just can't trust it. They really need to reinforce the bottom, it just isn't thick enough. After only 3 days of use, my bottom is now sagging, the thing is slowly melting!And I can't tell if I'm being too harsh, but I can't give a great design a 5 star review when the only design flaw makes it unusable. I just don't trust it now. It may be that this wasn't made to bring snow to a boil, and only used from already melted snow(water). This was never put into the coals, it was always hung 3 inches or more away from the coals. And it only hung over a fire at maximum 20 minutes at a time(though probably 8 times a day).I just can't tell, am I being too harsh? I hope GSI redesigns this, I will without a doubt buy that one. For now, I will be testing out other products.",2,"Maybe I was a little harsh, I just can't tell........",1385424000,"11 26, 2013"

A189YOAZ65PC6G,B004N62HJ4,bart arlington,"[59, 59]","last winter was the first full winter i rode through.  and, to be clear, what i mean by ""ride"" is that i did daily 30-40 mile loops on a road bike at about 20mph or faster (because this matters; wind chill becomes a significant factor when it's this cold and you're really moving).  i usually rode until at least the freezing point.  after that, i would only go out if i was sure there wouldn't be left over water on the road that would freeze and take me down.  so what i'm talking about are regular daily temperatures ranging from 25-40F, coupled with wind and me moving at 20mph or faster; which is really about an actual temperature well into the teens or single digits.for the first couple months, i SUFFERED with my hands.  nothing i tried worked.  i bought some super nice, very expensive softshell gloves and those only got me to about 40F.  awesome dexterity-wise, but not warm enough.  i tried some assos baselayer gloves under those and that only bought me another couple degrees.  the guy at the LBS talked me into the Gore ""fusion"" gloves.  which have two chambers (one for warmth, one for wind-blocking) and are a neat idea, but really didn't get me to any lower digits.  i even tried those goofy-looking and very awkward to use ""bar mitts"" and had about the same results as with everything else: every day i was coming home with freezing hands, running them under hot water for several minutes in agony, etc.then i finally decided i'd try a new solution: a warm layer and a wind-blocking layer.  i mean, this works for my torso, why wouldn't it work for my hands?  so i grabbed a pair of the wool defeet gloves for warmth (which are about $20) and a larger pair of these pearl izumi pro softshell lobster gloves to block the wind.  BINGO!  that did it.  now i'm very very cozy out there for at least a couple of hours.  i did a three hour ride in 35F with an average pace of 19+ last week and didn't even THINK about my hands.  which is exactly what you want.  this system got me through the rest of last winter and it's looking great so far this year.there are some downsides to these gloves, of course.  they're bulky.  but they're lobster gloves and they're THICK.  what do you expect?  you get used to it  (shifting with SRAM is easier than shimano with these, fwiw).  it's better than not feeling your hands and THEN not being able to shift (been there before; not fun).  and yes, the bottom velcro enclosure is a little tricky to do up.  but it's secure and once they're on, you don't have to think about it.  no big deal.a couple notes on my ""system"" described here: 1) i was careful to have a decent air layer between the two glove sizes, so that some air movement can go on.  you don't want them to be tight and constrict blood flow. the defeet gloves are tight, the lobsters are roomy.  2) the nice thing about this system is that if i flat or need some extra dexterity while stopped (to eat a bar, check my phone, change a flat, adjust my bike, etc.) i just take the lobster gloves off.  i still have the wool defeet gloves on to keep me warm and those are nicely form-fitting so they're almost like wearing no gloves.  and my hands won't freeze like they would had i worn a single-glove system (which would undoubtedly also be very thick gloves) and taken the gloves off for dexterity.overall, i'm quite happy with my solution and with these gloves.  hopefully someone else will find this information useful and can avoid some of the painful suffering i endured.",5,amazing gloves when used right,1352764800,"11 13, 2012"

At 30* they are comfortable without rubbing.  There is enough room in the finger area to get a finger out and against the palm of your hand to warm it easily if needed.  This is riding at a moderate to easy pace, riding at a higher exertion level will keep your hands warmer of course.  Sizing is true to the PI sizing chart.For those that complain about the Velcro, it is very aggressive and it's not easy to get these off if you line up the top with the base perfectly.  I line them up so the top is off center pulled toward the wrist / arm so about half of the base is exposed which leaves enough of a tab to grab on to for easy removal, they still hold very snug with this alignment.Took a few minutes to get used to riding with these but I can ride comfortably on the hoods, tops, bends, and in the drops now and feel like I have a decent grip on the bars.

She says these fit her perfectly. They are very well made and as far as I know, all Maui Jim sunglasses are polarized. Polarized lenses was ""a must"". I read on one page that the frames were Titanium? I cannot confirm this but they are light weight. The only thing I personally don't care for, which was not an issue for my wife, is the gold Maui Jim logo. The gold just seems out of place on a silver pair of shades with black lenses but, to each his (or her?!) own, I guess?

A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B004S2JY5I,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","Yes, in my opinion these are the best sunglasses in the world.  The frames are made of Titanium, so they are light and strong.  The lenses are Maui Jim lenses, which in my estimation are as good as it gets.  And to top matters off, these Maui Jim Baby Beach glasses are not oversized like almost all other sunglasses being pitched these days.  I am not a big guy or a fat guy, and these Baby Beach glasses fit my face to perfection.  The aviator style looks very zippy without that exaggerated oversized look that 'way too many aviator glasses have.  These just plain look cool.If all of this were not enough, these sunglasses also have a very nice gradient which is subtle, but functional, so that looking down there is more light than from the top.  This is great for boating and driving and most other activities.I bought a pair of the grey lenses with silver frames and I liked them so much that I immediately ordered a pair of the bronze version. The bronze/gold version has now come and it is every bit as nice, and sized exactly the same as, the grey version.  These sunglasses are perfect, according to me.

Go to retail store and make sure you know what you want and WHY (sleep on it and think for a while)2. order through amazon when ready to pull the trigger on buying3. ALWAYS keep glasses in their case or properly wore on your head...when you wear or place the glasses in pretty much any other way you increase the chance of messing them up...I have owned my Costas for over 5 years and NEVER messed up anything bc I follow these guidelines above.Hope you buy the glasses you want.

A2U914QYG3UQMT,B004SH1I7U,Christopher Bowling,"[3, 4]","Before purchasing this sight I read several reviews about the UTG low profile flip-up sight and was impressed with everyone's opinion on it. I had recently purchased a Sig Sauer M400 and needed a flip up front sight to mount on it. I already had a high grade flip up rear sight from my time in the Army years ago.After receiving the sight I almost immediately decided that I did NOT like it. First off the sight is very thick due to being over built. A LOT of metal is used to make the sight. This means that it will be pretty tough; however it also means that it has a lot of excess material on it. This intern adds a little bit of weight and does not make the sight very stream line. I also don't believe that this should be called a ""low profile"" sight. When the sight is folded down it does not sit very low. It was a little hard to see in the pictures that others posted on how low it really was. After I received it, I found that it did sit low enough to get out of the way of my red dot, but I felt like it was still too high. The next thing that I don't like about it is the fact that the sight flips down towards the front and not towards the back. If you are a shooter like me who doesn't normally keep his BUIS flipped up all the time, this could be a small issue. Reaching past the end of the HOT gas block during shooting in order to flip up the front sight could end up with burns to your fingers. I knew that it flipped this way when I purchased it and thought I could over look it. However, after practicing with it, I found that I didn't like the set up. The last and probably BIGGEST thing about it that I didn't like was the way the screw is tightened on the side. The sight is meant to have a flat top screw driver turn the head in order to lock it down. Unfortunately the way it is design, as you turn the head and the screw begins tightening down, the screw begins coming out through the head. Thus your flat head screw driver is being pushed out of the head the tighter you try to lock it down. I ended up having to use a crescent wrench to try and lock it down tighter which put several scratches in it. (Which is my fault) I never felt like I could get it very tight. I thought this was a very poor design.Ultimately I believe the sight is very durable and will work, however the size, function, and mounting are something to be desired. I would recommend this sight to someone who is on a tight budget and does NOT plan on using for hunting, home protection, or military use. If you have the ability to save your money and purchase something better, I would. I will try to post some photos comparing this to my new flip up sights for comparison soon.

It does have some play when in the up and locked position. For that reason I would not use it for the red dot or any other site or scope.

When it is in the up and ""locked"" position, it just wobbles all over the place. It is a design flaw. They have it loose so it will slide to the side. If you try to tighten it up, it will not slide out of the way any more. I would recommend just using a solid mont with a quick lever disconnect on it as apposed to screw slots that you have to tighten to put on and remove.

I dried it best I could. I had just got the bottle of tuf-glide and figured now is a good test. Without oil there was a lot of drag. So I gave the whole knife a good spraying and worked the joint a few times. Then I wiped it down with the tuf-cloth to remove the excess. I let it dry for a while (it does dry pretty well). I went to open the knife expecting it to flick out like it should, And nope. It came open slowly to the halfway point like it did when it was dry and when I was working it into the joint. I put a little more, This time with the needle point. Same thing happened. Disappointed I grabbed my benchmade blue lube. One drop on both sides of the pivot and bam! It opened like new.I am disappointed with this as a lube, but I am going to test it's protective quality on exacto blades which rust very easily. When I have results I will edit my review and add pictures of what I find. If the treated blade does not rust and the control does I'll give the product more than the one star I give it now.EDIT!I cleaned 2 exacto blades. They were a little different so I decided to test on 1 side of both. I applied the TUF-GLIDE with a q-tip to one side of both blades and let it sit for about 10 minutes. I wiped both of with a clean paper towel then put them both in a cup of salt water from my aquarium. I left them in over night and by morning the water was light orange with rust. I took them out. No doubt the unprotected side was very rusty, but the side with TUF-GLIDE was practically stain free! Given that exacto blades are cheap carbon steel I would call the minimum corrosion they had a success.

If something bad happens and I have to react quickly, I can criss-cross the two bandoliers, grab my Remington Mariner, and have two different loads at my fingertips immediately. A total of 112 rounds should give me plenty of firepower to handle most problems without worrying about using up my ammo.Using two at a time makes sense for two reasons. One is that you know which load is in which bandolier. The other is that the opposing weight of having one over each shoulder helps keep you in balance when shooting. Good shooting is all about balance and confidence.On the other hand, maybe I should switch to a high capacity .22 long rifle. I could carry a lot more ammo with far less weight.

If you are seeking very good advise, knowledge in operating a M4 / AR15 weapon platform, this is the video to get.  The ballistics on zeroing is a real eye opener and some people teach 100yd zero's, 200yd zeros, 25yd zero's, 50yd zero's etc.  The real gem was the 36yd zero and point of aim, point of impact feedback illustrated on the targets he shot.  He takes you through each zero target and talks about each zero's strengths and weaknesses.He opens up topics you might not use, but should be aware of in memory games and stress involvement depending on where you work and what you do.Cons: None worth mentioning.---------------------------------------------------------I was skeptical on buying this video based on all of the chicks dig it gear worn in the Magpul video's Mr Haley taught in when the basic weapon manipulation should have been the focus and all the multicam / chicks dig it chest rig cool guy gear, suppressors, etc, should have not been worn to detract the viewer from the meat and potatoes of weapon drilling and manipulation.Aside from those previous DVD's I bought this to see what Mr Haley would do on a solo project as an instructor.

Both the regular and remote (pad) switch function well.  In fact the remote pad switch functions much better than most low cost light/laser remote switches. Mounting was simple and apears fairly rugged.  Although the laser beam itself does not appear to be as bright as larger green lasers I have used in the past, at least with the supplied battery, it is sufficiently bright for both daytime viewing and low light conditions.  I would say its range in bright sunlight is 25 yds or so, in warm weather.  In low light conditions the range is incredible, a half mile or more.  Although the laser has no audible or felt clicks while sighting in, it was an easy process.  The laser has held point of impact during several range sessions.My only complaint is its sensitivty to temperature.  I am not extremely experienced with lasers, but it is my understanding that green lasers in particular have this problem.  I can't say how it compares to others, but this one shows obvious performance degredation when temperatures get down below 60 degrees.  In low light the laser is still visible, but outdoors the dot is almost invisible at 10 yards when the temp is 60 degrees.  At 50 degrees the dot comes on very dim, then slowly brightens.  I did not get a chance to test it in colder than 50 degrees, but I think it would seriously inhibit the usefulness if it was much colder, even indoors.  Veridian acknowledges performance issues with their green lasers in cold climtes, but claim their green lasers perform down to 30 degrees.  I doubt this one would be useful in 30 degree temperatures.  If your home defense/shooting is done in a colder climate, a red laser might be the way to go.  All in all this laser works very well, especially considering the cost, as long as it is in a mild to warm climate.",4,temperature sensative,1364688000,"03 31, 2013"

The magnetic fasteners work, but seem pretty weak. I think a snagged seat belt or jacket would easily open the case and expose the pistol.  I think Velcro or metal snaps (as used in the case provided with the Ruger LCP) would be stronger fastening approaches.  The bottom 1/4"" or so of each side panel is not fastened (neither stitched nor glued) to anything.  In fact, on the barrel side, the bottom bit of that side panel pouches out enough to make a noticeable gap or ""hole"" to look as though it was torn.

ARH3HZAWCUWLO,B005H2SKDK,S. Moceri,"[5, 8]",I purchased a holster for a Glock 27 from Sneaky Pete. After the purchase I noted my gun would not fit the holster because of a +2 magazine extension on my gun. I tried 5 times to contact the company for a return authorization as the gun would not fit. I was unable to receive a reply. On my last request I advised them I would dispute the purchase with my credit card company which I have done since no reply was received.The credit card company tried to contact them via phone but there was no answer and no request to leave a message. In their web page there is no phone number listed. My take on this is that this is a basement operation that has not even set up a customer relations site on their web page. The have an e-mail address but it would appear that the do not answer e-mail. They do say the will not accept any return without first obtaining a return authorization from them. After 5 tries on e-mail and no reply I find this company suspect and would never order from them again. It appears their only interest is to sell but not service the customer. I will never purchase from them again. I did see one of the holsters this past Sunday at my gun club with a Glock 19 inserted and found it to be big and bulky. Also at least 100% at the club meeting realized it was a holster just from the ads and the initials on the holster so I would have to question the sneaky part in the name. From experience I have found there are better concealment holsters on the market. Remember this is not a concealment holster because it is too bulky to conceal. In a very short time everyone will be able to identify it as a gun holster which will leave you sticking out in a crowd.Finally as a past law enforcement officer I can tell you that revealing that you are carrying a gun is a bad position to be in. If a criminal sees in during the act of a crime you most likely will be shot or place your life in great danger. Everyone across the country know what this holster looks like and you will be pegged a carrying a gun in a Ney York minute. Restaurants and business owners in my area have already banned people that walk into their business carrying an exposed weapon or holster. You will be a dead give away. I can only suggest you stick with a concealed holster for your safety and the safety of others. I tested this holster against my holster that has a trigger lock and my draw took half the time of the Sneaky Pete holster. I was on target with my partner testing the holster and his gun was only half way out of the Sneaky Pete. It's your call but I hope you take the safe road.,1,Waste of money,1381104000,"10 7, 2013"

This would be my first purchase of their products. I have to say, I like this knife by table top review standards so far. It is a bit small with a blade under 3 inches but big enough to do its job. The VG-10 blade steel is very good and used by Spyderco quite a bit so I consider it a higher end steel that takes a keen edge and shouldn't disappoint.The black coating also helps keep the blade resistant to the elements and is a nice even finish that is jet black in color. The sheepsfoot profile of the blade is attractive and allows the user to not puncture what they are cutting.  It could easily take a role as a rescue knife if needed in an emergency.The G-10 grip is nice and will wear in with use. The stainless spike is great as it isn't too sharp on its point and works well with the paracord knots I made to try it out. Since I live in a desert setting with little water around, this is a dedicated paracord knife. I like how both the blade and spike lock open. Both locks are secure with the liner lock for the blade being of decent thickness and the spike lock being easy to disengage via fulcrum action of the lanyard loop.The loop does swing freely but does not get in the way of the blade in a closed position.On the picture on Amazon, it looks stainless but it too is coated black but with a different finish than the blade. Eventually, the coating will rub off the loop. The only negative I can see for some is the lack of a pocket clip. It is like a modern traditional pocket knife. The loop makes up for it as I have already placed a nice fob on mine for easy access. The price is good for what you are getting.

A26DG05WFGH2V0,B005UGIR36,Gary Parlato,"[6, 6]","I never had a Mill dot scope before so i bought this one. It is preset for 35 yards. I put it on my Ruger Black-hawk .177 pellet gun. I used the scope rings that came with it. I marked off exactly 35 yards. I mounted it exactly like the instructions said to. I am not the best shot in the world but i am pretty good for a 65 year old man. The first shot using a shelf to rest the rifle on was pretty good. It was on the outside of the left side of the bulls-eye and just below the center line to the left and about 1/4 inch low. I turned  the elevation and the wind-age adjustments both two clicks up on elevation  and 2 clicks to the right on wind-age. I fired six shots and they where bulls eyes with about quarter of a inch grouping. I then shot eight shots from my shoulder without any kind of support and 4 hit the bulls eye and 4 were to the left or right of the bulls eye. I guess it was my unsteadiness that cause me to miss the bulls eye but still able to eliminate the rabies carrying racoons around here, and have rabbits for dinner. The adjustments for elevation and wind-age are very nice. You can adjust them with your fingers and they have very detente clicks to them. This scope has only one adjustment to it and that it has a focus ring. I then learned how to use the mil dots and believe me if you follow the instructions you can find the range to the target and which mil dot to use when the range to the target changes. The range is preset for magnification and you can't change it. I won't explain here how to use the mil-dots but read the manual that comes with the scope. I have some scopes with variable magnification and zoom in the $100.00 to 150.00 range and now i think they were a waste of money. You can find The range of a target or targets faster and more accurate then having to change the magnification or zoom on other scopes and it didn't effect the zero point at all using the mil dot. I now since the scope was zeroed in took 6 shots from exactly 66 yards away. 4 shots were bulls-eye and two about 1/4 inch away from the bulls-eye. I love this pellet gun and i am using Gammo Rocket pellets and crossman destroyer pellets in this rifle. The testing here was done with the Gammo pellets, I don't use anything else. Now i know i can hit anything from 15 yards to 66 yards out whenever i need to. I love it! Maybe that's why snipers use Mill-dot scopes. Read up on them on the internet and you may learn like i have. Now i am surfing the net to find a high dollar mill-dot scope for my 30-06 rifle. A inexpensive utg mill-dot scope has made a believer out of me. Follow the instructions in the manual for installing this scope to the letter. I don't think you will be disappointed on a pellet gun but who knows the outcome on a real rifle. I will let you know when i get a mill-dot scope for my 30-06. The scope comes with scope rings that haven't moved so far in over a hundred shots, a clear manual, Allen wrenches, cleaning cloth and nice detachable flip up lens covers that can be used on or off the scope if you don't want  to have them on the scope. I take them off because i like the front profile of the scope, it looks sporty instead of bla like most other scopes.

I really love whatthis scope has done for my rifle! At 15 yards (45 feet) its hard not to miss a soda can, and putting a .22 pellet throughthe ""O"" in a C0KE can is not impossible. For me this is more than enough accuracy to take down the rabbits that have beeninvading my garden areas. -Shooting the caps off 20oz plastic-soda bottles has also been fun at 50 feet!

I collect large bowie's and this is unusual in that is has a drop point blade. In fact it tends in the direction of a kukri as the sharp edge is also curved slightly downward. A true Bowie generally has a clip point blade. That is because they were originally intended to serve as a weapon among other things. Clip points penetrate better, if you know what I mean. Since I don't intend to use this as a weapon (assuming I don't get attacked by a grizzly) the drop point is much more practical, mainly because it makes for a stronger point--more resistant to breakage. It is big enough for small chopping tasks and the wide end gives it plenty of mass for this. The brass hilt is very classy and the sub hilt handle give one a sense of control. The rubbery handle is comfortable despite the boxy profile. The sheath is well made but a bit snug. It helps to wiggle the Knife when inserting it or removing it. I expect it to loosen up with time as long as the stitching doesn't get cut by the blade. I don't think it will. The strap is snug too, but is manageable.

It came ""cut you deep"" sharp from the package, and took a razor edge fairly easily.  After a full day camping, cutting cane poles for bank lines on the Neches river, etc.  It was still as sharp as when I started.  I am not normally a fan of rubber handled knives, but this one handled well, and had a good tight fit (The Green Beret De Oppresso Liber brass inset in the handle is a nice touch).  If I had ANY complaint about the blade it would actually be that the leather strap on the sheath on mine was about a 16th of an inch short for the snap to work.  After a day of sweating on it, falling in the Neches river, and working with it, it JUST DID manage to snap close.  The sheath is a good snug fit even without the snap however, and I didn't have to worry about losing the blade.  NOTE: I added a leather wrist lanyard to it as soon as it left the package.  Don't want to lose it on a clumsy swing, or hurt anybody.  Overall a great product.

I went with this particular model instead of its bigger brother because I felt it would shave off several ounces and fit better on my hiking gear. (It is now attached to the side of my pack where the weight is easily distributed and is easily accessible).The construction is top notch. The 1095 cro-van steel holds a good edge while providing a good resistance to chipping and dings. Just don't go attack the tin man with it and you should be fine ;) This model has the exact same full tang design as the classic USMC Ka-Bar so there are no surprises there. The thickness of the blade is just right. Not too thick so it turns into a brick and not too thin so it can be easily bent or broken. As far as materials and construction go, have no fears this thing delivers it to you on a silver platter. The sheath that is provided allows you to store the blade for easy access as a lefty or a righty. There is also a tiny pouch built into the sheath to store a wet stone.The design of the kukri, in my honest opinion, is a far better choice than the classic bowie style. Its basically the marriage of a large knife and a hatchet. This versatility allows you a VERY wide variety of tasks that you may require in a survival situation...and yes as far as self defense goes, you would NOT want to be on the receiving end of this thing.The kukri design has been around for thousands of years and thanks to Ka-Bar we now have a modern version comprised of modern materials stamped with that good ol' U.S.A mark that we are all looking for these days.

I can't call myself an expert in exercise mats but I did discuss this one with my wife who claims she is one - she's a user anyways - and these are the qualities features she's looking for, each rated.- Length/width (4 of 5) - perfect for her but I deducted one point because it's a few inches shorter than I would be happy with. I suggest that they either add another 6 inches to the existing length or maybe sell a 'taller' mat as a separate model because not everybody is 'average'.- Comfort (5 of 5) - the foam is soft and, even when deployed on our basement's concrete floor, the mat supports the body well with some thickness to spare. Can't feel the cold floor underneath.- Maintenance (5 of 5) - does not absorb moisture when wiped clean.- Portability (5 of 5) - not an issue for us but, yes, you can easily roll/unroll the mat and it only takes seconds to strap it into its carrying harness.- Price (4 of 5) - at the time I'm writing this the price appears to be in line with similar products out there.To conclude, for as long as you are under 6 ft. tall, this is a good pick for an exercise mat.DISCLAIMER 1 (fine print): the vendor sent me a free 'for review' mat.

In fact, it puts in mind a pair of shoes that were touted as the most comfortable because they used a soft, squishy, silicone sole.

I've been feeling pretty bereft that I can't manage to put weight on my knees, elbows, etc. This wonderful pad changed that. I just finished a 30-45 minute work-out on it and my body feels great!

Morgan,"[0, 0]","The solution is, of course, making your own bracelet so you make sure it fits exactly.The description was appealing to me, where it says it is curved to fit the wrist.I just now ordered this product but will update this review once I have them in hand.Update 3/13/13: Actual measurements of the buckles gives me: 11 mm inside width of slot to hold the cord, or webbing, depending on the band material you plan to use these for. That is wider than the nominal 3/8"", which would correspond to 9 1/2 mm.Actual length of the closed buckle: one inch and an eighth.The appearance and function of the thing is first rate, based on ones I've seen in various applications.Update 3/14/13: see my customer photo of the stretchy bracelet I made using these snap buckles. I gave a brief description of how I made it, in the photo caption. The fabric is a very stretchy rayon spandex that I bought at Jo-Ann's Fabrics and is one of their own prints and (I think) was discontinued, but you can get the same material there in a camo print. What this means is that you don't have to bunch up the material to allow the stretch because the fabric stretches along with the elastic. I made this because I wear a 'high performance' long sleeve shirt for UV protection that had no provision for keeping the sleeve end tight, so flopps around when it gets wet, like it does since I am wearing it in my kayak. So I need something to keep the sleeve end from hanging over my hand that I am trying to use to hold my paddle. If you were to just make a straight band, one: it would quickly wear out its holding ability by stretching it so much to get over your hand, and two: it messes up the alignment of the sleeves and UV protectant gloves, putting it on that way. You set all your layers in place on your wrist, then last, buckle the strap, and everything is good.",5,Nice Alternative to Hit and Miss Sizing,1362700800,"03 08, 2013"

A2YP0ANEM0N2OJ,B00AU6EICA,Chris Jarman,"[1, 1]","After owning multiple other air rifles (multi-pumps, CO2, a few springers, and one nitro piston) I've finally found ""The One."" What can I say? I am very, very happy with the .22 Synthetic Marauder.  For the price, I imagine it is going to be hard to beat this rifle.  After several months of owning and shooting this rifle here are my thoughts:Pros:-- Plenty powerful. Using 21 grain Kodiak Beeman pellets and factory settings I'm getting over 30 foot pounds at the muzzle (Chrony measured and ChairGun calculated). Fiddle with the power and you'll get significantly more.-- Very accurate.  Even with my under-powered 9x Leapers scope I can easily smack invasive pest birds at 60 yards. I can make effective shots out to 90+ yards.  When I upgrade to a Hawke scope soon, it's reasonable to think these numbers will improve.  This rifle will quickly outperform modest scopes.-- Adjustable: The adjustable stock comb makes it easy to customize my eye relief and head position. That improves accuracy and comfort.-- Trigger: The trigger is adjustable down to a ridiculously light pull.  It's easy to go overboard and make it target-rifle light.  The trigger is crisp and solid.  I'm very happy with this feature.-- QUIET: I can shoot this in one room while my wife is working in the next room. The integrated baffles really do work, and work well.  This rifle isn't silent, but it's backyard friendly for certain.  The baffles are easy to remove for barrel cleaning.-- Solid, hefty construction: The synthetic stock is plenty rugged for hunting.-- Sling lugs: The SynRod comes with lugs for a sling, a very nice feature (because the rifle is not particularly light).-- Magazine: I've read elsewhere about reports of jams, but I haven't had a jam or double feed yet. Flawless operation through at least 1000 pellets.Cons:-- Rails: This rifle has no Weaver rails. It has the standard airgun 11mm dovetail scope rails.  So be prepared if you want to mount a scope using Weaver mounts, a bipod, a laser, a light, etc, etc.  It's pretty disappointing that Benjamin hasn't caught on to the accessory trend in shooting.-- Ummm.....  Honestly, that's it.  That's my only issue with this rifle.I'm no expert but this beast is far and away the best air rifle I've ever shot.  It is accurate as hell, quiet as all get out, and rugged to boot.  This is a serious rifle, with plenty of power for long range targets and/or small/medium size game.  It's quiet enough for backyard use, and not a budget buster.  I believe it's also American made, so that's a huge plus.  I went ahead and purchased the scuba tank, fill station, and hose, and I'm glad I did, especially when the action gets going.Some data I've obtained using a chronograph and Hawke Optics ChairGun for different pellets using factory settings:10 shot string of Beeman Kodiak 21.10 grain: Average MV: 811 fps. 30.8 foot pounds. SD: 12 fps. Initial/final PSI: 2700/2080.10 shot string Crosman Premier Ultra Magnum Dome 14.3 grain: Average MV: 901 fps. 25.8 foot pounds. SD: 13 fps. Initial/final PSI: 2720/2270.I'll update again when I get some more JSB Exact Heavies, which seem to have great long range abilities.",5,Love it,1405728000,"07 19, 2014"
AB67PZ0XJXZCF,B00AU6EICA,jeffharper47,"[20, 21]","Ive owned only a couple break barrels and this is my first step into the PCP world. I bought mine from Pyramid Air because they had a great bundle package that couldnt be beat.The synthetic version is incredibly light. It feels WAY lighter than my benjamin titan xs synthetic stock. But more importantly it is incredibly balanced. Im 6ft 3in 225lbs and the rifle feels absolutely perfect. i was worried about the length of the rifle causing it to feel heavier than it actually was due to leverage but this was not the case. the grip is excellent and feels like your holding a thumb through stock. I bought mine in 22. Ive read that the .177 and .22 barrels are a &#34;hit or miss.&#34; i believe that crossman has fixed the barrel issue with the .22 because from what ive been reading on the forums all the newer made .22's have been shooting well. But speaking for my rile, it shoots 1 inch groups at 50 yards with the pellets (crossman premier hollow points 14.3 grain) that came with the bundle.This thing is incredibly quiet. the pellet hitting my back stop at 50 yards is LITERALLY louder that the rifle firing. The trigger is incredible light out of the box. I believe it has a 1lb pull and feels even lighter. Its' got a nice short first stage followed by a predictable and very crisp breaking 2nd stage. I wont be making anything more than VERY minor tweaks to the trigger if i ever feel the need to.I bought mine with the pump. the pump is not hard to do. it takes quite a few pumps to fill up from zero. but after that it takes me about 30-35 pumps to pump from 2000psi-3000psi. the key is to take it slow and use your weight and not to pump more than 25 pumps at a time to allow the pump to rest a bit to insure a long life. if you dont weigh more than 185, it might be a little more difficult. you just have to decide if spening 400-600$ plus the rifle is in the cards for you. In the next year ill def be buying a good tank set up but the pump will do just fine for now.You just cant beat the marauder. I looked into other pcp air rifles in its price range but pick the marauder for a few different reasons;- there are tons of mods- There are alot of info on the forums and youtube- It has all the features you could need- crossman has outstanding customer support- it is INCREDIBLY tunablespeaking of tuning. this thing can be tuned to do WHATEVER you want. there are 3 major adjustments that can be made. the metering screw (which is the main velocity adjuster) the Hammer spring tension screw, and the hammer stroke screw. the latter two can be tuned with out taking the marauder apart. the metering screw requires you to remove one screw to release the stock from the from the rifle. I plan on drilling a small hole to access it with out dismantling the rifle to make it easier. The rifle shoots great out of the box and there is really no need to do any major tuning to the rifle from the get-go. the only thing i did was tune it fill at 3000 psi.what you should know about rifle;the barrel is dirty from the factory. i believe its because crossman puts some kind of protecting goo in it to stop any chemical wear. I guess they don't know how long it'll sit in a factory before shipping out. all it takes is some cleaning patches run through it.you need to find the right pellets as with any air rifle\. even the same two air rifles will like different pellets. It may shoot well with most pellets, but there will be one pellet that it likes the most. i recommend a pellet sampler from straightshooters.comIf you want to do lots of tuning you'll need a chronograph to see how fast it is shooting. the rifle is capable of a lot, but without an accurate way of measuring velocity, you wont really know what your adjustments did.",5,awesome rifle! .22,1393891200,"03 04, 2014"

A2QGOE9VHBNPKS,B00AU6EICA,Outdoor Fun,"[45, 46]","This is simply amazing for an adult air rifle. I have the .25 and it is incredibly accurate. Very quiet and no recoil. I was so impressed with this air rifle that I had to buy another as a gift for my father. The synthetic stock feels well made, the trigger is very nice and adjustable, still using green mountain for barrels for the .25 and the weight feels well balanced. I cannot believe that this air rifle is made in the USA is under 1000 and seems on par with European air rifles in the $2000 price range.  It does take some effort to pump to 3000psi but that is expected. I bought a Swedish pump instead of the Benjamin pump which has had longevity issues according to my research.  If your looking to blow some cash on an air rifle I recommend trying the Synrod in .25 first.  Pellets are a bit higher cost than .22 but they can be ordered online in volume for less than pre panic .22 rounds. The JSB exact kings seem to be the go to pellet for accuracy but my rifle shoots the Benjamin domes well too (so far the only two pellets tested). You should be able to achieve a 16 shot string around 850 fps without much effort from 3000-2200 psi. I have not messed with my factory tune yet because it has a very low extreme spread of 12 fps for 16 shots. If you crank the power level up to 900 fps expect shot count to be reduced and noise level to be a bit louder. At mid 800 fps the pellet hitting the target is the loudest sound. At 40 yards it will put 5 pellets into one jagged hole.",5,Amazing in .25,1388188800,"12 28, 2013"
A157NQRMC5ZSER,B00AU6EICA,Roy,"[24, 24]","I was up in the air for a while trying to decide if this rifle was worth the money prior to purchase.  Further more, deciding between the .22 and .25 was very difficult,  namely because there were very few .22 reviews available for the synthetic stock version.  Being that none of the sporting good stores had either in stock to even handle, it was going to be an expensive, blind purchase.  I have only had the rifle for about a week, but have fallen in love with the beauty!  I wanted to write a quick review on the .22 in hopes to help anybody that may be in the same situation I was in.I decided to go with the .22 for a couple of reasons.  Though it has a crossman barrel vs the .25's green mnt barrel, the .22 has a higher shot count and better pellet prices.  Being that I love to target shoot, it seemed to fit my needs a little better than the .25.I have only been able to shoot it 15 yards at my indoor range (ie basement), but this thing is driving tacks consistently through 30 shots.  Seriously, dime size groups using only a front rest!  This is without custom tuning, just straight out of the box.  I've pushed 40 shots through it before refilling, but I have to believe if I was actually shooting at any real distance, the pellet drop would be evident (though at 15 yards its not).  The 21 gr Beemans have been flawless so far, and the rifle seems to really like the jsb 18gr heavys and the jsb 15 gr diablos.  Unfortunately,  the crosman premiers group poorly, regardless of what the fill pressure is.  The crosman are not only shorter, but seem to be a hair thinner as they fit loosely in the mag.  I cannot emphasize how happy I am with the grouping of the beemans and jsbs, consistently putting them through the previous shot's hole!  100x better than my break barrel, and the marauder doesnt require the special ""artillery hold"".This rifle is every bit as quiet as everybody says, u litterally wont here the gun, just the pellet hitting the target.  The weight is not bad, and it is very well balanced, again - feels way better than the break barrel's weight.The trigger is, imo excellent and plenty adjustable to your liking.  The pressure guage, at least on mine, reads about 200psi lower than that on the pump, but its not a big deal.I have to mention this - if you are new to the pcp world, like I am, figure on a tank set up at some point.  Most people consider me to be in good, strong shape.  I dont work out like I use to by any means, but still bench more than my body weight for reps.  But pumping this thing wears me out!  And will put blisters on your hands!  To refill the 30 shot count, it takes a good 80 to 90 pumps.  I take a break around the 50 pump mark, load the mags, then finish pumping.  A tank is definitely in the future for me...  While I am talking about shot count, I will mention fill pressures.  I have been filling it up to 3000psi, and after 30 shots its down to about 1800psi.  I do not have a chrono (yet), the marauder doesnt seem to favor a particular area in the pressure at the short distance im currently shooting at.  Im sure it will once I try her out at 60, 80, and 100 yards, but that is fine.I wont go into details about other aspects of the rifle, being I think there are already plenty of reviews or info on it.  But hopefully this helps somebody decide if they want the .22 version or not.  Like I said this thing is a tack driver, and has to be one of the best .22 pellet rifles on the market.  Hopefully I can give an update once I have been able to try it at farther distances.

I've tried numerous training aids--their downside usually include the vast wasted time searching for shot balls or insufficient exercise.Whack--that was fun!  And I'll shoot better too, in the future, because I quickly analyzed how I shot this ball.So here's the math.  I can probably take 15 swings with this device for every 1 swing using other training devices, because don't have to spend time retrieving shot ball.  Even going to the shooting range takes driving time and money.  The device does give a fair indication of whether I've hooked or sliced.  So, at 15 times more practice than other devices, it simply a better training device.  More motivational fun too.I give it a three star, because this trainer needs several improvements.  First, the rope attachment has a plastic piece that became loose on the first day.  This product defect needs to be quickly solved, but, still playable.  The defect costs two stars.Second, it's not really a permanent placement device for the backyard, because it doesn't take but a few shots for the base stakes to become loose in the ground.  Third, a tip should be included in instructions to use a 9 inch steel nail and hammer to dig an initial hole into ground.  This nail tip enables the trainer to become portable.  Fourth, the ball height adjustment isn't gradient variable.  The device does has 3 height settings, but the ideal lowest height--as if ball was on grass--isn't easy to achieve.  Fifth, its three stake ends have only one rubber protector--needs 3 protectors, for easier transport without puncturing other itemsThese five problems are relatively easy to solve, so I hope this product will improve over time.

A39LRLKACX89IP,B00BEQ1F94,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[1, 1]","I read some of the other reviews, and I wonder what people really expect for under $20.00.  This has heavy-duty quality construction and if the right soil conditions are found, it plants itself very securely.  There is a large square steel support that drives into the ground in the center, and two sharper small spikes to support the two sides.  In loose ground, I can see this moving a bit, but in normal medium hard soil, things stay still after even a number of good hits.  Even on special sale, getting something like a Medicus driver will cost you $160.00, and more with tax and shipping. That is more than 8 times the cost of this tool.  Again, it's not cheap, the steel is heavy gauge, the ball has enough weight to it to give you stroke a little bit of feel.  Plus, there is a three level adjustment for going between driver, woods, and irons/wedge.  This adjustment takes a little bit to move because of the snap in lock that has to be pushed down, but that may be a moot point since most will practice with the same club for a while and don't have to change often.As far as how it works.  Well here's a little story from my background history.  In the late sixties early seventies era, I used to like to play tennis.  One day a 20-minute documentary on PBS told the instruction method of one Tim Gallwey.  He called his training the Inner Game of Tennis, and later wrote the Inner Game of Golf.  What the premise of the documentary was that several students, who had never even picked up a tennis racket in the past, were miraculously hitting 20 shot rallies across the net!!  How this was done was to understand that the mind is capable of many things immediately, you don't need the muscle memory (although it helps).  Look at professional sports guys, there are stars who score and play great, some from day one, and there are others who get good over time.  It always seems like they climb a hill, get a breakthrough, and then take it to another level.  The reality is the ability to focus on a particular activity is nearly innate is some and trained in others, and still others never seem to learn.How do these tennis beginners accomplish this in one lesson?  Well it's a trick sort of, and it ties into how this trainer functions if you allow it.  In tennis, Tim Gallwey told his students when hitting the ball back and fourth, to look at the exact instant it hits the court and immediately yell out ""bounce"".  Then at the exact instant you strike the ball, yell the word ""hit"", and continue this.  This tricks the students into mentally focusing on the position of the ball and they then naturally get in position to hit it back.  As a refinement you could call ""rising"" or ""falling"" when you hit a shot to tell if it was still coming up or down on the bounce.  There are similar drills in his golf book only with the golf ball.  This, depending on you watching the spin will tell you slice, or hook, or good center hit as a feedback.  It does nothing more than that, but if you practice with it you will eventually his the thing dead center and then your drives or iron shots should be improved!",4,"Not as bad as other reviews might suggest, good value!",1370649600,"06 08, 2013"

This is probably the most important ""PRO"", because if the SKLZ Pure Path Swing Trainer didn't actually help me to attain a repeating, functional golf swing, it'd be worthless, right? By the way, I validated the feedback I got from the SKLZ Pure Path Swing Trainer at a driving range within hours of each session. The components of my swing, including address, ball placement in my stance, and the actual swing (from takeaway to follow-through) which I had nailed down with the Swing Trainer provided very good results when striking real golf balls. Every aspect of my ball-striking improved: distance, direction, and above all, consistency.CONS:1. This is a biggie if you care at all about the appearance of your lawn; using the SKLZ Pure Path Swing Trainer is GUARANTEED to result in divots. Even though we don't have a manicured lawn on the front, side, or back yard, my Spousal Unit registered an immediate and strenuous objection to my golf-related excavation. Even if you only use it in one place, the rut will grow impressively in a short period of time. While the obvious solution is to buy a practice mat, a good quality mat is fairly expensive, and takes up a lot more storage space, plus you have to drag it out and put it away for each session.2. You have to be smarter than the equipment when it comes to installing it. Fortunately, after years of bending metal tent-pegs in our rock-hard clay ""soil"", I used a steel spike and a sledgehammer to create holes for the Swing Trainer's pegs. Otherwise I likely would have bent it by trying to force it in the ground. So, ""Know Your Terrain"" before installing it!3. If you make the mistake of setting up your SKLZ Pure Path Swing Trainer in a place visible to passers-by, your non-golfing neighbors will razz you, and any other golfers residing in your vicinity will come by to offer ""helpful tips"". I make a practice of ignoring any and all wannabe ""PGA Teaching Pros"", unless they also provide me with an ice cold bottle of ""Swing Lubricant"" at the same time. Still, these distractions can be irritating all the same.In summary, the SKLZ Pure Path Swing Trainer is a useful implement for instilling muscle memory and obtaining a ""grooved, repeating swing"". Despite the ""cons"" I've listed, for most mid to high handicap golfers this would be a worthwhile investment.",4,Pros Outweigh the Cons,1370649600,"06 08, 2013"
ASJLXOX1VD4DF,B00BEQ1F94,"Fermata ""D.S. al FINE""","[3, 3]","I recently started hitting golf balls again for the first time in probably at least 5 years.  At 7 to 10 bucks for a bucket of balls -- not to mention gas money -- I was hoping for something fairly economical to practice with and get my swing back...I am the very rare left-handed women golfer so one thing I was pleased at was that this accommodates left-handed golfers with no problems.However, I don't like the feel of hitting a ball on a rope.  It doesn't feel ""natural"" to me -- and if you practice to where you try to hit this ball well, I don't think it is going to translate to when you are out on the course because you will have adjusted your swing to accommodate ""false"" feedback.Getting the gizmo setup correctly and keeping it set up correctly is also annoying so that you are spending more time trying to adjust the ""trainer"" than you are actually hitting golf balls.  As another reviewer has mentioned, after you hit a few balls, it starts to come out of the grass and has to be re-seated.  Plus, getting the ball height correct for your club means that you are a) only going to really be able to practice with one club or b) constantly spend time adjusting the height of the ball (my driver is a modern ""over-sized"" driver... but my other woods are normal size so the ball height is significantly different depending on what club I am hitting.When we lived at our old house, we set up driving range net and a driving range matt on our back deck.  For me, that provided a much better backyard solution that will last longer (though significantly more expensive for a decent net).  But the advantage is that I can focus on my swing and not on fiddling on the setup of this device.Golf isn't a cheap sport.  I think the cost is probably artificially inflated -- but trying to save money on using this trainer isn't going to really benefit your game.  However, I guess if you are having a bad day and just want to go out in the back yard and hit something, then this will do the trick![NCJVR]",3,Won't put any golf pros or driving ranges out of business,1369440000,"05 25, 2013"

This one seems relatively well made and has what is unusual, as it uses spikes to insert itself into the ground for stability.  The stability issue depends very much on the clubs you are hitting and the type of ground you have.  Here in West Texas you may need a hammer to pound the spikes in the ground, and then they'll work loose fairly quickly.  In more traditional soils it will stay put longer.  Also, hitting a driver will move it around more than a wedge or mid-iron.  As for the ball on the rope and its ability to tell you whether you are hooking or slicing...well that really only works for really bad cases of the lefts or rights.  Decent golfers who may have a slight fade or draw will not see enough deflection to make a serious decision about the shot.  If you limit its use to practicing your swing with a bit of feedback, then this is fine.  It would be about the same as hitting into a net for practice, as you will not see the ball flight.  Better than the hitting net, in that the ball is always teed up and you don't have to keep collecting them out of the net, it has its benefits.",3,"Reasonably well built, but of limited use",1369872000,"05 30, 2013"

The cord connecting the ball is too short to provide useful feedback about my swings. As long as the ball is hit, the ball just swings around without much difference. There is no way for me to tell if I hit the ball at the sweet spot, or too high, or too low. All I know is...I hit the ball.Actually, if I didn't hit the ball, but hit the rope, the ball swings around too. Well, at least I know if I have missed the shot. When you hit the ball, the force will pull the unit off ground a little bit. So, keeping it seated firmly into the ground after couple of swings is a pain. I find myself constantly sticking it back into the ground.All in all, if you need help with just hitting the ball, then this SKLZ Pure Path is a good choice.

A3JL3YQYI7OR5O,B00BEQ1F94,Jason Chamberlain,"[2, 3]","When I ordered this from Vine I thought that this was something that sat on a mat because I didn't notice the light spikes going below it. I was a little disappointed to find that it has to be spiked into the ground, but of course that makes perfect sense. There is one long spike and two shorter spikes. The long spike is hollow, so I imagine that it will be more difficult to use over time as it fills up with mud. Fortunately, we've had a lot of rain lately, so it was easy to push this into the ground and start whacking at the ball.The ball height is fairly easy to change, though there are three notches where it is secure in the post. You could fine-tune it away from the three notches, but it won't be as secure with just the set screw to hold it in place. I got the ball about the height of the high rubber tees at a driving range.The rope is fairly short, so it is hard to be sure about how well you hit the ball. I intentionally sliced a ball and it gave me good feedback to let me know. But I think I was just slightly off a couple of times and it was hard to tell if the rope was spinning perfectly straight or not. It is difficult to get precise feedback from it.What I did find is that I tended to hit the ball a bit more consistently because I wanted to keep my head down. I am not a very good golfer, so this is a problem for me. The feedback was in the trainer, not in watching the flight of the ball. It also helped me six year old son keep his head down too. He hit the ball on this trainer much more consistently than he does at the driving range.So if you're a complete hacker like me you might find some value in this.

I usually take them to the range but young kids can get caught up in wanting to see the ball fly and getting discouraged if they top or hit fat.

I don't use it myself or would I recommend it to someone that can strike the ball with even a fair amount of force.

Firstly, it has three spikes on the bottom which allow you to push it into the ground.  There are two smaller spikes, and one giant central post which is REALLY DIFFICULT to get into the ground.  I stomped on this thing and still couldn't get it to be flush with the ground.  Second, the ball on the end of this feels kind of like a real one - but not enough.  I wish it were heavier so hitting it would feel more real.  Third, I used my driver with this and it did indeed show that I had a wicked slice.  But I knew that already.  So, now what?  Keep hitting it until it's straight?  I don't know what to do or what to change.  It's like you hit the ball, and now what do you do?

If for some reason you aren't able to get to a range, and don't have a range setup in your back yard, you might turn to something like this. How well does this work?First the construction. It has spikes that drive down into the ground, so you definitely can't use this inside. This is meant for outdoor use only. However, the ball hangs so low to the ground that you can't play with a grass mat beneath it, to save your lawn from being chewed up. It does have a three position setting, but those settings don't give you enough options. It really needs a more flexible setting option that also lets you go to a higher height.When you hit the ball, it tends to pull the unit off of straight. Over time this causes the unit to wiggle loose, meaning you are now trying to prop it in place with rocks or other objects.The purpose of the trainer is to give you feedback when you hit less than perfectly. However, even when we tried to deliberately hit poor swings, there just isn't enough of a change to give solid feedback.I think it's much better to get a net, to use your clubs in a far more natural way, and to set up your cell phone or camera on a tripod to video what you're doing.

Not only that, but when you hit the ball, you can watch the yellow rope spin straight, to the right or to the left. I can actually see in which direction I'm hitting it. I know once I get my swing better, make good contact with the ball, feel my grip getting comfortable, and see most of my shots going straight, I'll be back on the driving range.

So take this review for what it's worth.I have two problems with this golf trainer.The first thing that hit me before I even tried it was that this was going to force me to keep looking down toward the ball to observe the effect of my swing.  Everything I've been taught has been about not doing exactly that.  The reason this issue was apparent is that the rope holding the ball is loose and swings freely.  I was expecting a rigid design in which the ball was struck and moved only a few inches so that you could observe the angle AFTER you've swung.  Straight up and down would mean a good swing, angles a bad swing.  Instead the ball is loose so the only way to observe the effects of the swing is to keep your focus on the ball and tee.  If learning how to golf better is about building muscle memory and habit then this is a bad design.Secondly, I found that I hit the ball every single time.  I'm sorry, but I'm too lousy of a golfer for this to be right.  I quickly figured it out - it's very easy to hit the rope as well as the ball.  In other words, the strike surface is a whole lot larger than if you were striking an actual ball off the tee.I need help to improve my swing, no doubt about that.

A9UMKMCB0AE12,B00CJUR99O,Bivens72,"[0, 0]","I have purchased at least a dozen of these knives, and give them out as gifts to friends, keep one in each of my vehicles, as well as keep one in the kitchen and one in my bug out bag.First off, let's get this off the table, this is a Morakniv clone. Not as good as a Mora, but an attempt at a clone nonetheless, and a good knife. One of the major differences is the blade has two grinds (first a flat grind, and then a second edge grind) which differs from the Mora, which has only one grind to the blade.  This results in a knife that cannot be made as sharp as it is, though you can certainly reprofile the edge if you desire. I personally don't, and just run this over a knife steel as soon as I get it, first away from the blade to straighten things up, than across the blade to get the edge nice and sharp.At this price, you can use them for anything, prying, batoning wood, whittling, whatever and if you break it (though I haven't yet), you can get another (or three) for less than the cost of a car wash. These blades are stainless, easy to sharpen, hold an ok edge, and the &#34;cheap sheath&#34; is actually as good of a sheath as you find on genuine Moras that cost 3-4 times as much.I would recommend recommend these as additions to your camping gear, as well as the other uses mentioned above.",4,Great set of knives for your B.O.B. or Car,1399939200,"05 13, 2014"

Don't expect this to be a quality piece of cutlery for the price that you're paying.This knife will cut wood.  Sure.  If you're in the jungle and you need to process wood for fire, it will do an okay job.  But you will not be doing wood carving and reaching for this to be your precision instrument.  No professional wood carver will be reaching for this as his ""go to"" tool.You're not reaching for this as your field dressing knife.  If you're in a survival situation, and this was all that you had, you could use it to butcher whatever it is that you're lucky enough to hunt.Since everybody has the idea that they will need to survive in the woods with nothing except a knife; this knife can keep you alive.  Although in real life, how many of us will find ourselves in the woods with nothing except this knife?  You could strip bark off a tree, cut vines, dig dirt, shuck oysters, pry abalone, cut the stinger off a scorpion, crack open coconut, and put an end to any game that you trap.They call it a fillet knife.  I suppose that if you caught fish, you could use this knife.  But no fish monger will be using this in lieu of a real fillet knife.Can you defend yourself?  lacking a hand guard, repeated thrusting and stabbing could cause your hand to slip over the handle and onto the blade.  Just imagine trying to stab a zombie  through a leather jacket, the blade getting stopped by ribs or a shoulder blade, and cutting your own fingers off.  While this is not a fighting knife, you can fight with it.  If this is all that you have, you can still slice a zombie's throat from ear to ear, slice the achilles tendon so that he can't chase you, stick it into his eye socket, carve a big smile into his belly, or run the blade along the inside of his elbow to disable his arm.I know a guy who carries aKA-BAR Full Size US Marine Corps  Fighting Knife, Straight, but it never leaves the holster.  In the cab of his truck, he has one of these.  This is what he uses to pry open shipping crates, break down boxes, slice off pallet wrapping, cut zip ties, et cetera.

A10QUY14I0ZYFL,B00CULFR4Q,Ketty,"[2, 3]","I don't understand the reason behind the abundance of 5 star reviews given to this product. For the price I expected a better light! I am disappointed because this light looks like a cheap aluminum flashlight powered by 3 AAA batteries. The light might look fancy because it comes with a mount and a lens in the front that allows you to focus the light, but really the light itself feels and looks pretty cheap.  When you open it up to put the batteries in, the internals of the light looks like those cheap chinese mass produced flashlights you can buy from the dollar store. The beam of light this flashlight produces isn't that great. Unfocused, the flashlight only dimly lights up like 2 feet in front of my bike, hardly useful when it comes to biking on unlit urban streets when I'm trying to avoid j-walking pedestrians or dangerous potholes. It also has that annoying diffused light ring effect in the light it shines, the kind you find in cheap flashlights! The only way to make this light bright enough to illumine something is to focus the beam with the lens in the front. However, once focused, the light  would only be able to illumine a very small area the size of a ""no parking/stopping any time"" street sign at 50 feet away. This focused light is very targeted and doesn't seem to do anything except potentially distract drivers in front of me or blind a pedestrian in the face. It reminds me of the times in elementary school when kids would bring mirrors to class to mess with people by reflecting a spot of light on the ceiling or at the teacher's face.I would not call this light a headlight. I would only use it to increase your visibility for oncoming cars, not for illumining the road. The 3rd photo posted on the left on the product page does not reflect the actual product I got. The actual light produced by this unit is much dimmer and has an annoying refracted light ring around the main beam of light. Oh and the tail light I got was cool for one day except now it won't stay on! Whenever I click to turn it on, it would turn back off. Garbage. I'd rather pay $30 more for a brand name head light that works better.Update: If you search on Amazon, you can buy a similar flashlight for about $8, a mount for $4, and the same taillight for $3.

I use it exclusively on my commuter bike on roadways and have had no such problems though.The unit has 3 modes: High, Low, High Flash. It is also able to be focused from a wide beam to a very tight spot. I travel on village streets that have street lights so I use the flash mode to be visible to vehicles. The light is extremely bright and I'm quite pleased with that. It comes with a wrist lanyard for use as a regular flashlight.

Although this light is of high quality and puts out a nice bright beam, it's inadequate for trail riding at night.The mount connects to your handlebar, which mine are tilted to the sides, so my beam was constantly off to the right a little bit, not centered.  Every time I came to a left turn, I couldn't see the trail in front of me. Also, the beam isn't nearly bright enough to trail ride at night.  With all the turns, dips and obstacles, I felt extremely uncomfortable riding in the dark.At one point, I rode off the trail into some bushes because I couldn't see where I was going.  I'm estimating this light to be about 900 lumens.  Some of the other ones I saw out on the trail were about 4000 lumens or more!I think this light is more than sufficient for riding at night on the street where there is ambient light. The strobe feature of this light would be great for day riding on the street so cars can see you.  But for trail riding on a moonless night, this isn't going to cut it.The interactions I had with the seller were superb, I can see they really want to take care of the customer.

I'm shocked at all the rave reviews for what is a mediocre product at best.  It is identical to the same product sold on Amazon for less than $8.00 (with Prime shipping BTW) from other sellers and the &#34;free&#34; taillight is $1.00 from any number of sellers.  So for $9.00, you can have the exact same product, mount and all.  I was expecting a leap forward in lighting technology that would let me see 1,000 feet as per the advertisement.  You're lucky to see 100 feet and if you focus it all the way down, the lens is behind the LED and all you get is a spot projection of the LED.  Fortunately, it only took about two minutes to realize what the seller is shipping and put in the return request.  Got to give Amazon credit, they have the best return policy in the business but I'm frankly surprised they haven't booted this seller from the site.Someone else mentioned that the only place you can buy this is either the auction site fleabay or here and it's more money on fleabay.  So when you see reviews that aren't an Amazon verified purchase, be very, very skeptical of their authenticity.  And, these negative reviews seem to get tagged as unhelpful very, very quickly so that they will fall off the first page of the product reviews - coincidence to a concerted effort by unknown parties - you decide.",1,Major disappointment in an overpriced product,1386201600,"12 5, 2013"

A2YE94LKZJ095X,B00CULFR4Q,zdb,"[0, 0]","I bike commute through Los Angeles on a daily basis. Since everything is very well lit in this city and the drivers seem to frequently forget that cyclists exist, I wanted a light more for being visible to drivers around me than actually lighting my path. I'd used cheapie LED handlebar lights that certainly wouldn't stand out unless a driver were explicitly looking for it, so I opted for something a little bigger and easier to see. This light is absolutely it.The light mounts quickly and easily to the handlebars with just one screw -- mine hasn't budged since install. There are three lighting options: always on bright, always on dim, and bright strobe. The strobe is fast enough so that it allows for navigation if in a dark area as opposed to a slower strobe that isn't lit enough to see with. The real kicker with this light is that you can drastically narrow down or open up the iris, allowing for the light to be tightly focused or spread out very wide. When I ride with the light opened up to ~75% of the full way, I can easily see my light reflecting off road signs on the opposite side of the street, making me visible all across the road. And, as the name implies, it is extremely bright. I'm certain much brighter and more expensive options are out there, but I have no qualms about the brightness of this light. Perhaps if I were riding in complete darkness I would want something with a little more oompf. Bonus points for the light being quickly removable from the handlebar mount, though I envision rarely needing this functionality.Batteries: it's powered by 3 AAA batteries that are not included. I use standard Duracell rechargeable AAA batteries. I commute ~7 miles for about 35 minutes each evening in bright strobe mode and I my light starts to dim after 5 days of use. I don't have much to compare it to, but given the brightness of this light, I find this to be reasonable. Your mileage may vary, of course.",5,Perfect for the commuter.,1389657600,"01 14, 2014"

The flap that covers the hole for the fuel will not last long as it attaches to the base that covers the grill and bends at several points. The plastic is already showing stress after one use.

Put the top (large) part on first and make sure it snaps in all the way around then the bottom round part just slides on the bottom hole perfectly. If you do it backwards it puts stress on the connection strap.The grill warping is from not warming it up with the stove. Don't put a cold piece of metal on a hot stove and expect it not to warp. If you heat up the grill with the stove it doesn't warp.Clean up being hard. ??? Someone is just stupid or lazy. Let it cool off and the 3 pieces come apart very easy and just take brush and scrap it clean or leave it dirty, put the covers on and wash it at home in the dishwasher.I've used it 10-15 times so far this summer for hotdogs, brats, burgers and steaks and it's been perfect for all of it.

A1HHG4MB4THR30,B00DAMWXLO,"Greg K. ""grku""","[0, 0]","This is my third jump rope (not counting anything I had as a kid). The first one I loved but eventually snapped. The second one looked great on paper but the handles were too heavy and had this annoying habit of shedding little pieces of plastic meant to protect the rope.Then I found this one from Master of Muscle, and I was impressed at just how good a simple thing can be.  Now the owner, Dre, who is probably reading every word of this review, would likely disagree on the &#34;simple&#34; part because 1) there's a lot of obvious design inside that makes it seem simple when it's probably not, and 2) because you don't just by into this product, you get Dre with it.On the design: it's light, it's fast, it's small in my hands but quite comfortable. Making adjustments are fast and easy (easiest I've ever seen in any jump rope).  The swivel is clean and fast. The cable is durable, and the whole thing packs away small and light. That was my main reason for buying it since I go through Road Warrior phases and do my best to stay fit with a strong need to get a cardio workout even when I'm just trapped in a room on the 40th floor of some city I've never been in.  Why fight the two other Americans in the hotel room for the one Stairmaster when you can get the job done on your own terms?About Dre: this guy is going to email you after you buy the rope, and he'll send you a decent workout e-book. Then he'll follow-up. If you answer, he'll follow-up again.  The man is committed to this product and your success with it, and it shows. You get the impression that he has oriented his life to providing the best possible jump rope on earth and a support network that goes with it.

It describes in detail how to fit the rope to you (which is very easy) as well as the basics of various jump rope techniques.  It then goes into a number of workouts ranging in difficulty which I suspect would help a lot of people.  I'm new to jump rope but reasonably advanced in weight training and calisthenics so a lot of it was known to me, but I still like having a lot of good workouts to mix in.  It has various rope only workouts also which is what I wanted most.The most common complaints I saw in these reviews regarding the handles feeling &#34;cheap&#34; and the wire hurting are both pretty unfounded in my opinion.  Those people simply don't understand what a speedrope is.  It needs to be as light as possible as well as balanced.  Robust handles simply can't be made to work.  And the wire hurting part, well it would not be a speed rope if it didn't.
