It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great.",5,"Worked for Europe - Norway, Denmark",1311811200,"07 28, 2011"

Is it the best it could be....not by a long shot but it works and that goes a long way.I use it for business calls and have yet to be called on it. That within it self makes it a winner but the Gennum nxZen almost works that good. The difference is I can hear this one with relative ease as opposed to the nxZen. If you boost the microphone (on the nxZen)gain it decreases the in audio which is a issue. I prefer the ""in-the-ear"" type headset because I'm always using it in loud places like airports etc. The built in boom slides forward and provides excellent out audio for the receiver. I still, struggle at times, hearing the caller. The talk time, so far, is very good. I can wear it for several hours but at some point my ear does start hurting.I use this with my Treo 700w.

My cell-phone was too old and could only be used to make phone calls..Then, I finally upgraded my cell-phone.So now all I needed to enjoy music from my phone was a USB cable to connect my Nokia to my old Compaq computer(the computer upgrade would come only recently).I first decided to order a no-name USB compatible cable, big mistake. So I went back and ordered the Nokia OEM CA-53 USB data cable, great choice!I've had the cable for about a year now and overall, it works great. The cable material itself feels much better than the generic brand I bought. For the most part, the music that I rip from my CD's are transfered flawlessly to my Nokia phone.The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes the physical connection between the USB cable and my Nokia phone is a little too easily knocked-off. So I have to take care not to touch the phone at all while data is being transfered.Overall this is a solid choice that I definately recommend for your Nokia phone.",5,No more CD Walkman!,1222387200,"09 26, 2008"

There's a padded flap in between the halves of the case that pushes into the other half a bit.  That compresses the cable in the other side and makes it so nothing moves around.Functionally, that's a great design, but for looks I would have liked the scanner to fit completely into the bottom, with a thinner top half for the cable.

ASHMKDJI9Q3K4,B000Q5J2M6,K. Gehrke,"[5, 5]","My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.",5,"Can you buy a better headset?

I tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working.Overall, the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly, it will crack. However, we all want a lightweight headset...so maybe I shouldn't complain. The Scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the # on your cell phone. However, you have to press the button on the Scala after picking up incoming calls. This results in a 2-3 second delay...an eternity if you've got another person on the line saying ""hello? hello?"".It's got its drawbacks but it's the only headset that works consistently with my Treo 650.",4,Works well with Treo 650,1202860800,"02 13, 2008"

The Scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity, and handle wind noise far better than any Motorola I've used.  I only recently replaced my 500 (battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it wouldn't hold a charge) with a 700, which I loved--until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine.  The 700LX is nearly identical to the 700, with one added improvement.  The earpiece on the 700LX, unlike the base 700, has a much stiffer wire for custom fit.  This way when you get it to fit, it is more likely to fit AFTER you mash it around in your pocket.  Another great feature is turning off the blue blinky LED, so you can be a bit more disreet when calling.  It has a bunch of other features, too many to list but most are useful. I'm surprised this brand isn't more commonly availabe in stores--it works outside in the wind, it has great sound, and is tiny.  What more can you ask for?",5,Best Scala yet,1199491200,"01 05, 2008"

A3QA13W0Y7TM86,B0019M7DD0,"Mike S. ""-Mike""","[4, 4]","Picked this headset up after buying the TL7610 by mistake. I have only had this for about 48 hours but it has already had about 20 hours of use. I have had 10 different phone systems and headsets looking for nirvana. My job has me on the phone all day. Sometimes 14 hours a day or more so I'm becoming an expert in phone systems and headsets.Setup:First of all, the configuration was VERY easy. You need to follow the instructions for your particular base system and NOT the instructions that come with the TL7600. My system (TL8609)pairing a headset instructions were in the very back of a very large manual. Press the ""Hold"" button for 4 seconds and BAM! registered the headset in 5 seconds.Comfort:I agree the over the ear piece is a pure torture device. Hard plastic, non adjustable in-ear piece and did not even come close to fitting in my ear. If it fits your ear, great but the hard plastic is going to hurt with extended use. I never like anything in my ear anyway so I use the headband. I find the headband on the TL7600 very comfortable. In 2 days I have had it on for at least 20 hours. After a while I forget it is even on. I can't comment on the behind the head strap as I never use those.Ergonomics:The base is a little odd. You really need to slide the headset in from the top. Makes it a bit of a pain but not a major issue. The headset sits right night to my mouth and the overall feel is excellent. I find the mute button is in the perfect spot for my use and the little ""beep"" every 15 seconds is nice to remind you that you are on mute. The only real issue here is the way you need to transfer calls to the headset with my particular system. In this one area the Plantronics was better. With this, you need to dial a number then hit the ""select"" soft key twice to transfer to the headset. If you get an incoming call on line 1 you can simply push the power button on the headset. If a call comes in on line 2 you must push the call to the headset. A minor annoyance but I'm already pretty fast at doing this.Sound Quality:Far better than any other wireless headset I have tried. I had a Plantronics which was 4X the cost and people constantly complained that I was fading in and out. The further I walked the worse it got. That system is considered to be one of the best and now it just sits in my closet as I went to wired headset thinking I'd never find anything better than the Plantronics. So far this thing is amazing. People say I sound clear and I don't need to shout over people on a conference call to be heard. Some have said the volume is too loud but I do not find that to be the case. Mine is set a couple notches up from the lowest setting and it is the perfect sound for me. I walked all over my 3600 st ft home and kept connected with no issues anywhere in my home. I did not go into the basement.Build Quality:Seems like a well built unit some complained the headband is cheap and breaks. I find just the opposite. The headband is steel and has a nice padded piece for your ear and the other plastic parts seem sturdy to me. The base is solid with only a single power line with a small wall wart on the end.Overall I am very happy with this purchase. My headsets get more use in a month than most would get in a year so I'll report back in about a month.",4,Almost Perfect,1352419200,"11 9, 2012"

ASAWQWJ7AF5NF,B001FWYXF0,Troy Edwards,"[0, 0]","First things first, make sure you are ordering the right headset.  These fit a 3.5 mm jack, NOT the old 2.5 mm that you would find in most other/older phones.  Easy way to test if you're not sure, take an iPod headset (or any headset you use for a mp3 or CD player), and see if it fits.  If it does, than you are looking at the right headset.Before getting into too much detail let me first give a concise Pro/Con summation:Pro:Best earbuds on any headphones I've ever used.Con:The microphone is as equally bad as the earbuds are good.Despite being slightly shocked by just how good the earbuds were, these are of no use to me if the microphone is unusable.The Sennheiser MM50 iP Earbuds / Headset have the most outstanding sound I've ever hear from a headset, but an incredibly BAD microphone.  Also, the Sennheisers were engineered to keep the microphone close to your mouth by placing it at the Y of the headphone split, and making on line short enough to pull the mic close to your mouth.  This is an awful design that should never be repeated.  I found myself constantly having to repeat myself when talking on this headset.I can say though, that with the Sennheiser Earbuds, I could hear details in my music that I never heard before.  A simply amazing sound, with outstanding isolation capabilities.  In a very noisy gym, I could keep my iPhone at a low volume and still hear great detail to my music.In comparison, the Ultimate Ears MetroFi headset keeps the normal, symmetrical Y shape to the earbuds, and places the microphone on one of the lines, close to your mouth.  Having my wife call me on her Chocolate 3 phone, I was at first disappointed. ""Did you forget to bring the headset with you?"" I asked.  Nope, she had them on.Over the years, between the two of us, we've probably used about a dozen different headsets between the two of us, and the MetroFi set was the clear winner when it came to microphone quality.  Funny thing is, to look at them, you wouldn't think it.For earbud quality test, I compared them to my Sony, J2, Metrofi 170vi, and iPod earbuds (all noise isolating except the iPod).  Sound quality places the MetroFi 170vi down by the iPod headset, and sadly, they were probably equal to the iPod headset for noise isolation as well.  The Sony and J2 earbuds were roughly equal in both categories, far behind the Sennheiser, and slightly less far ahead of the MetroFi 170vi and iPod set.Comfort wise, I would rate the four as follows: Sennheiser (again, by far), MetroFi 170vi, Sony, then J2 (So bad, they caused one of my ears to be sore for days)Durability could probably be a little better, but they haven't failed me yet.  So far, just one of the 1 1/2 inch sleaves, attached to the earbuds has come off.I would recommend the Metrofi 170vi set over these.  IMHO, when wearing headphones that are also a headset, microphone quality trumps headset quality.edit 11/28/2010I earbud died shortly after this review. It kills me, 'cause for comfort and sound quality, nothing beats these... nothing even comes close to these. Unfortunately, a crappy mic, and poor durability make this a lousy product.",2,Incredible earbuds don't make up for poor microphone,1253145600,"09 17, 2009"

The mic housing is a bit heavier than I would like and I don't like how the right cable is made to go behind your neck. Also, no case is included. Also talking on the phone with these is not comfortable at all because of the seal they make in your ears, you can't hear yourself talk!

Coincidentially this SAMSUNG WEP 460 was on sale and seemed a bargain but buyer beware, you get what you pay for.With the Motorola Bluetooth when you open the thing to attach it to your ear the unit turns on. When you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off. This Samsung WEP460 has to be pushed to turn it on and off which is a pain in the neck to get used to and is an extra step. If you forget to shut it off after taking it off the power stays on and the battery will get drained.Worse is the fact that the charger it comes with is a standard AC adaptor for recharging inside your home. The way the packaging is, the charger is hidden inside a plastic bubble container and hidden behind black paper. You have to look very closely at the back of the packaging where an image that is 1 millimeter is shown -- look closely at that fine line drawing and that is how you will know the charger inside is AC for indoor use.We had been in the routine of using the Bluetooth when driving the car and charging it in the car and just leaving both the Bluetooth and its charger in the car all the time. We don't presently own a cigarette lighter car recharger that fits the SAMSUNG WEP460 so that would be another purchase for us (therefore raising the price of the cost of owning this unit vs the Motorola Bluetooth). Today I see the compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells for MSRP $45 which is more expensive than this SAMSUNG WEP460 Bluetooth unit itself which seems crazy!The sound quality is just fine.We regret this purchase. Next time we'll buy the Motorola Bluetooth.We also learned a lesson that the cost of these accessories is not just the accessory but the charger units.

A couple of Motorolas (which I love), an Emerson, etc. This one has great sound quality. The volume is pretty low when you first put it on, but after turning up the volume it works great. The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable. It comes with two ear hooks, but not two different sizes. It's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost. It also comes with several speaker covers, so that it will fit inside your ear better. It's too bad then that the ear hooks don't come in sizes. Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear. I tried switching all the speaker covers, but that doesn't have anything to do with the ear hook. Also, because there is no wire in the hook, you cannot bend it to fit your ear properly. That is a definite design flaw. I have tiny ears compared to the average person. This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear. That is not the case at all with my ears. This is why a curve is important for me, but there is none and no way to make one.In fact, if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth, you'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook. It is commonly known that all should have a slant. I guess you get what you pay for. I never had this issue with my higher grade models. The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable. This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on. It's not how I put it on, my daughter (who works at Radio Shack) even tried to help me, but without success.If I could replace the ear hook, then it would be a top-notch bluetooth, but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating.

A3U41ZL33SS92P,B00295RBNI,"Kevin Nicholls ""jaded, aging hipster""","[8, 9]","I've got aBlackBerry Bold, as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side, but given the price of this phone, the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously, nothing's really ""as good as"" a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES), and nothing available right now is ""as good as"" an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference, those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package, with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X, so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box, I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately, is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&T;).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal, and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls, and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question, this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then, the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail, contacts, and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy, until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately, once you have something in the wizard, it's there. There's no ""Back"" button. So, the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately.""No problem"" I thought, I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. ""Options"" doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button, then go to Applications, then go to the ""MfE"" folder (which is incredibly cryptic, if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed, the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options, like setting ""prime time"" for a constant sync, and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications, and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already, this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail, and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up, and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, I tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my Exchange account. Apparently, the N97 can't do this, either. You can have one mail box on the screen, regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones, Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up, I made a couple of calls (which again, had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day, I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out, the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all, the N97 requires you to hit the silver button, then go to Setup, then Connectivity, then Bluetooth, then Paired Devices, then pick the speakerphone, then hit ""pair"" every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings, you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing, and is labeled ""Answer"". If you tap it, nothing happens. If you hit the green button, nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either, nothing.Feeling like a complete moron, I had to look it up. It turns out, the bars are sliders, similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet, this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password, and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version, which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to, until it crashes. Yes, that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full ""I'm kicking you back to the home screen"" crash, and other times, you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try, I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see, despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies, the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this, I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer, or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped, others single-tapped, with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you, and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly, there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool, since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure, there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation, the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable, given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review, the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24), so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date ""any day now"", the N97 is for Symbian fans only.",2,It just isn't good.,1254441600,"10 2, 2009"

AU5V90NU1ON6O,B00295RBNI,Tor Slettnes,"[80, 83]","[This is an updated review; some of the issues that existed when the N97 was first released have since been addressed.  Also, I have moved some of the more elaborate details of the original text into a new review (""A Guide"") that I created for thewhite version.]Nokia E- and N-series phones have for some years now had, by far, more capabilities than anything else out there - but they have not always been the sexiest or had the widest mass appeal.  Plus, although Nokia sell more smartphones than anyone else worldwide, they have not targeted or marketed the US market very heavily (thanks in part to our combination of non-standard wireless technologies and frequencies, consumers' focus on style over substance, and Nokia's unwillingness to cater to the fairly heavy-handed branding and crippling of functionality demanded by US network providers).Much of that is changing with the N97.  As you can see it definitely has the visual appeal.  Also, its main enhancements over the most recent N-series phones (such as theN95,N96andN85) are user interface centric:>> 640x360 WVGA LCD>> Touch screen>> QWERTY keypad>> Faster CPU (ARM11 at 420 MHz vs. 332/369 MHz in the N95/N85, and two ARM9 cores at 265 MHz in the N96)>> Configurable widgets for the home screenThere are a couple of other improvements as well:>> 32GB of built-in storage, SDHC card slot for up to 32GB more (Nokia always advertise only the tested configuration, 16GB)>> Additional sensors: Magnometer (electronic compass), ProximitySo, yes, Nokia have finally bit the dust and moved onto the post-iPhone touch screen bandwagon.  But whereas Apple borrowed quite a few UI elements from theMotorola Ming, and other manufacturers in turn tried to copy the iPhone look and feel, Nokia has taken a decidely different approach: They have taken most of their new design elements from their ownInternet Tabletsline (e.g. exchangable home screen widgets, keypad layout, etc).  They have also done so while keeping the underlying OS from their previous smartphones, Symbian/S60.I don't care much for this direction.  To this day, I would take theE90any day over the N97, had it been released with support for North American 3G (UMTS) bands.  The E90 does not have a touch screen, but does have a numeric keypad on the outside in addition to the QWERTY inside the shell -- this allows you to ""type"" with one hand using the native T9 predictive input, and mostly keep your eyes elsewhere while dri... eh... walking.As it is, Nokia ended up with touch screen phones (starting with the 5800 XpressMusic) kicking and screaming - it kindof shows.  The user interaction paradigm is a little odd at times -- probably mostly due to the S60 legacy. [Lipstick/pig joke deliberately omitted here]. For instance:>> You need to double-tap on icons (once to select, once to open)>> They still retain ""soft keys"" on the side to access menus an the like (though now they are located on the display itself, and occupying quite a bit of space).  The home (previously ""standby"") screen has three soft keys; the left and middle are always ""Options"" and a a dial pad, while the right one is configurable (""Contacts"") by default.There are some other usability issues with this phone as well:>> Copy & Paste functionality is a bit more cumbersome.  There are no keypad shortcuts; with the keypad open, cut/copy/paste are only available via the menus!  Moreover, not all text input screens have such a menu available - in which case you need to close they keypad in order to bring up a virtual numeric keypad with a context menu at the top of the screen.  Or, if you use an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can press Ctrl-X/C/V.>> The keypad layout is a little unusual at first.  The navigation keys are on the left (which some gamers like, but I don't).  The space bar is in an odd location on the right.  Mixed alpha/numeric input is cumbersome because the digits 0-9 are ""shifted"" via a key on the right side of the keyboard, while the standard shift key is on the left.  Plus, in some dialogs you get a helpful numeric keypad on your screen, but it defaults to text input (2=abc, 3=def, etc) rather than give you quicker access to digits! (Why, Nokia?  You already have the keyboard?  What are you thinking?).  That said, the tactile feedback is good, not too ""firm"" or ""clicky"", but with a good feedback.>> There is a nice E-mail status widget for the home screen, but you can only have one of these.  If you have multiple e-mail accounts (e.g. for work/home), you can only monitor one of them.  The same goes for some of the other widgets too.>> Direct media controls are gone (the N95/N96/N85 had a dual slider design giving ready access to play/pause/previous/next).  There is a home screen widget available, but it is hardly as convenient (e.g. if you are using an application, typing a mail, etc).Some other limitations that I found so far when compared to their previous N-series phones:>> The amount of available RAM (dynamic memory) available for applications is low (around 55MB, versus about 75MB in the N85/N95).  UPDATE 2009-07-01: This may not be an issue after all. With the latest firmware update from Nokia, the available memory seems to have increased to about 65MB - and in general, the only time I have had a ""out of memory"" error was while running RoadSync, which explicitly warns that it is not compatible with this phone.>> Adobe Reader is no longer included in the price of the phone. It is still preinstalled, but now only on a trial basis.  If you want to continue using it after some days (about 3 weeks I gather), you need to purchase it - similar to QuickOffice.>> The number of applications available for this phone is somewhat more limited; this is only the second Nokia phone to use the new S60 5th edition user interface w/touch-screen support.  Although most of the older applications will still run on it, there may be some that don't.  Notably, Nokia Internet Radio is not included,  nor is it available for download yet. :(>> Synchronization of phone contacts/events/todos is not yet supported on the Mac, as Nokia have not as of the time of this writing released an iSync plugin for it. (You can still synchronize with Microsoft Exchange, use the built-in ""Switch"" application to copy contacts from another Nokia phone, or you can transfer contacts as vCards from another phone).>> Getting Bluetooth Stereo Audio (A2DP/AVRCP) to work with your Bluetooth car stereo is hit and miss.  More on my experiences in this regard in the ""white"" model review.>> The UI is generally a bit ""sluggish"" - moreso than my previous phone, the Nokia N85, despite a faster processor.  The touch UI probably has a lot to do with this.  (Then again, both the N95 and certainly the N96 did not break any speed records by any stretch of the imagination).All that said, most of these issues are software/firmware related, and will improve over time.  As it is, the N97 is perhaps the most capable phone on the planet today -- a jack of all trades, if you will.  It certainly has improved over previous N-Series phones in a number of ways as well:>> E-mail reading is dramatically improved - especially in clients with HTML support (e.g. System SEVEN). Also, because most of these integrate into the ""Messaging"" application, messages are listed much more nicely in the mailbox -- the larger screen is used very well here.>> Web browsing - what a pleasure. This was the main attraction of the iPhone - but I think the N97 surpasses it. Kinetic scrolling, variable zoom, and quite a speed improvement.  Of course the previous strengths are there too - the way the ""Back"" button brings up snapshot views of your previously viewed pages, Flash, etc.>> The phone has quite a ""solid"" feel to it, without feeling like a tank.To be sure, there are phones out there with better cameras (e.g. Samsung Pixon), more newbie-friendly user interfaces (iPhone), better support for a variety of corporate e-mail standards (Blackberry), and so on - but hardly any that have the combination of all these features in one device.  The closest may be the close cousin Samsung Omnia HD, which:>> runs the same OS, has the same screen resolution and many other features>> has a better camera (yeah ""megapixel blur"" but also optics), HD video recording>> faster CPU (600 MHz vs 420 MHz)but:>> does not have good support for U.S. 3G frequencies, and>> does not have a keypad (QWERTY or otherwise).These two shortcomings pretty much kills the Omnia HD as an alternative for me.Also, aside from the N85, the N97 is the first Nokia phone to support tri-band UMTS (""worldwide"" 3G).  This means that you will get 3G speeds (mostly) where they are available: 850/1900 MHz for AT&T; Wireless and other carriers in the Americas, 2100 MHz elsewhere (including Japan).  That said, for complete worldwide coverage you would need ""penta-band"" UMTS, with the additional inclusion of 900 MHz for Europe, and 1700 MHz for T-Mobile USA.  No phones currently support all of these bands.  NOTE: There is also a ""standard"" version of the N97 for international markets, with support for 900/2100 MHz internationally and 1900 MHz for roaming in the Americas.You probably won't see this phone subsidized on contract by a carrier anytime soon.  The primary candidate would be AT&T; - but it looks like they have passed on it (perhaps they don't believe it has mass market appeal).  Then again, if you are looking to get this phone, you are not likely to be the type of person who would accept their lockdowns in the first place.  Look no further than the differences between theunlocked Nokia E71versusAT&T;'s E71xfor a prime example: In AT&T;'s version, various features are disabled (keyboard shortcuts for copy&paste;, the S60 native e-mail reader, network selection), and instead a number of non-removable, non-renamable, non-movable AT&T; specific applications are installed.Another upside of buying an unlocked phone like this is that it may cost you less in the long run.  It seems I'm unable to get actual numbers past Amazon's editors here (see comments) - but if you have a standard SIM from AT&T;, you can plug it into this phone and add a standard ""data unlimited"" feature.  In contrast, if you get a smartphone on contract from AT&T;, your data plan will be at least twice as expensive - which adds up over the 2-year contract term to cover (at least) the price difference between most of these and the unlocked N97.  Plus, you would of course not need to renew your contract with an unlocked phone like this.  AT&T;'s generally subsidize their phones a couple of hundred bucks versus the unlocked equivalent (except the iPhone, where the subsidy is closer to four hundred, but where the more expensive data plan is mandatory).Finally, if you take your unlocked phone with you abroad, you can walk into a store and get a pre-paid SIM -- that way you local tariffs, rather than pay (outrageous!) roaming fees to AT&T.;Now for a couple of practical aspects and caveats:>> If you are looking for a unique look, go for the white model, not this black one.  Some also think it is better looking.>>If you are going to use the N97 in your car, to play music or for GPS turn-by-turn directions, do yourself a favor and get a cradle/mount for it.  For instance, there is a Brodit cradle (available from ProClipUSA) specifically designed for it; this is one part of a two-part mount, the second part will be specific to your vehicle; you can get one from either ProClipUSA, PanaVise, or Pro-Fit International - they are all compatible.  Or, if you want a universal holder, the Bracketron Grip-IT works nicely for the N97, and can also be put on the same vehicle specific mounts.Finally, if you are looking to get this phone, it is important that you get it for the capabilities, not ease of use.  Like other Symbian/S60 phones, getting used to it takes a little persistence and discovery, but it will grow on you over time as you explore it and learn more about its esoteric features.",5,Beauty and Brains - Together at Last!,1245283200,"06 18, 2009"

I would give that alone 5 stars.  It is crystal clear, on both ends of the call.  And really that is the meat and potatos of this device.But what made me buy it is the FM modulator utility.  I will be honest, when I got this thing Friday and hooked it up I was so excited.  And it seemd to work really well.  Scrolls the number of the person calling on the radio.  Switched to music seamlessly.  It was nice.  But now its been 3 days of use. And here is what I have noticed:1) It will drop the FM signal if there is no use happening for 1 minute2) Because of 1) above, when someone calls you, by the time you hit the FM modulator button and turn the radio to the station, i will bet you that you missed the call.  Because that what happened to me everytime.  So really it is only good if YOU initiate the call.3) Signal is inconsistant.  Sometimes its cyrstal clear.  Sometimes there is so much static it is unusable.  I found myself, on an 18 mile drive, constantly searching for a new radio frequency to be clear.  I can imagine if you live in a bigger city, this is impossible to do/find.4) The info announcements via RDS on the radio screen are also inconsistant.  Sometimes it would scroll the number across of the person who is dialing. And most of the time it would not.Maybe there is some trick I am missing.

I was finally getting fed-up of something stuck in my ear all of the time so I could talk while on the road.  I live in the Tri-State area, NY-NJ-CT and drive about 4 hours a day, therefore making Bluetooth a necessity.And now for the review:Box Includes: Visor Clip, Car Charger (Micro USB), and documentation in English, Spanish, and French.**Quick Note: This device also utilizes Micro-USB as do most new smart phones in the market today.  It is the new standard for cell phone chargers and thus will eliminate a lot of redundant chargers in our homes, offices, and cars.Simply charge the device over night so that it is good and ready to go for your usage.  Once charged, turn it on and pair it with your blackberry device...the instructions are quite simple.  The pairing process complete, you are ready to clip this in your cars visor and begin the process of becoming a road warrior.The Visor Mount actually gives you a few language options, as follows:US EnglishUK EnglishFrenchItalianGermanSpanishMexican SpanishBrazilian Portuguese, andChinese.Why do you need all of these options?  Simply because the Visor mount actually has a voice feedback system that provides you various bits of information.  It will announce an incoming call (with the number, it will give you its status (power on, power off, pairing mode, etc).The design of this device is slick as could be and the voice quality is quite impressive...even while driving about 65+ miles per hour on a highway with the air conditioning running...(yes its been hot in NY/NJ).  I made quite a few test calls and specifically asked the party on the other line about noise and quality...they said, and I quote, ""You are in a CAR?"".  The speaker is quite loud and can be adjusted to your liking with a volume rocker panel on the right hand side of the device.This device works and it works quite perfectly.Now for the most interesting feature, an FM Transmitter.  Current Blackberry models all have the ability to accept micro-sd cards up to about 16gb.  You are able to get free software to sync your iTunes libraries to your Blackberry...as long as the content is DRM free.  Once the music is on the unit you can play it back through headphones and or Bluetooth devices.  The Visor Clip takes this whole process one step further...yes it will play back the content on itself or allow you to press the FM button on the left hand side and select a frequency to tune in on your car stereo.  Voila, your blackberry is now broadcasting through your car stereo.  This also works for phone calls...  AWESOME!  Impressed yet...?  There is more, when you live in a congested area it is sometimes hard to find a FM frequency that works well with transmitters (we all know they are not great).  Simply press and hold the FM button on the Visor and it will scan and announce a free frequency it finds on FM...tune your radio and you are set to go.Battery Life: I have been using it for 2 days with moderate call volume and some music for testing purposes.  It is still working...it does have somewhat of a battery meter on it.  But real life usage will vary for everyone and thus you will have to make your own decision about how long it works for you and when it needs a charge.  It comes with a car charger..so its not too much of an issue. :-)This is the best visor clip I have ever used and I am glad I decided to get one. 5/5 for a great product at a great price.

A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B002LG2HK2,Andrea Polk,"[7, 7]","I purchased my OtterBox Commuter case to protect my first-ever smartphone: a Nokia E71.  I researched the different OtterBox offerings and decided to save a few bucks by purchasing this one instead of the Defender, but I probably should have splurged.  Primarily for the additional screen protection offered by the Defender series, which in turn also gives a tiny bit more protection to the keypad by putting a 'bridge' of sorts (horizontal crossbar underneath the screen and above the keypad) that might take some impact if the phone hit the ground face first. The Commuter doesn't have this and after I played with the phone a bit I thought about how great it was and how awful I'd feel if I dropped it.  ""Live and learn?""The case was very easy to put on, feels good in the hand and came with a clear screen cover that went on easily once I viewed the tutorial on 'how to' on the OtterBox website.

AAEVGE52KL0DJ,B003XAEJZG,Tim,"[4, 4]","I originally bought this to mount my HTC EVO 4G to the dash of my Peterbilt. Now it secures my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, with a massive extended battery that doubles the weight and thickness of the phone. I've noticed that one or more reviewers have complained that the adjusting mechanism eventually failed. I haven't had that problem at all, and I have to squeeze the jaws very tight to keep my very large and very heavy phone from bouncing out while driving down the road (remember, I'm using this is a Peterbilt, so it's a very rough ride compared to a passenger car).I have had two issues with this cradle, and both problems are probably unique to my application of the device. Problem number one is that theZeroLemon 9300mAh Extended Batterymakes my phone so thick that it has a problem staying in the cradle. It occasionally bounces off the two little feet that the phone sits on. This shouldn't be a problem for most people, as the battery I'm using is pretty extreme in size, and it wasn't a problem before I upgraded to the monstrous battery. Problem number two is that the swivelling arm that attaches the cradle to the base keeps breaking. This problem got worse with the addition of the extended battery. I'm using this cradle to mount the heaviest and largest phone out there to the dashboard of a Peterbilt. After nearly twenty years in trucking, I've learned to expect the early failure of anything that resides in my truck (not specifically built for the purpose). The ride of a truck is much harsher than that of a car, and I put about 120,000 miles a year on it. If something fails in my truck after six months, that's like it lasting six years or more in a passenger car. I'm having the arms made out of aluminum and that will forever fix the broken arm issue; and I'm having aluminum feet made that are a little longer and have a lip on the end to eliminate the problem of the phone falling out of the cradle.Despite the issues I'm having with this cradle, I still feel it deserves at least four stars. The problems I'm encountering won't be an issue for most people, and if they are, then you're probably asking too much from the thing like I am.",4,"Great Mount, but with One Caveat",1381536000,"10 12, 2013"

It makes the phone easier to grip and protects part of the phone from bumps and small drops.  As a protective case this is a great product.  Obviously this item offers no production for the screen itself, which is probably the most vulnerable piece of the phone.One annoying feature is that the nub the belt clip snaps onto.  It is large and prevents you from laying the phone flat.  If you did not need the belt clip you could probably remove this nub.  However, if you need the belt clip, this piece has to remain and it's quite annoying.The belt clip can be used as a kickstand to prop the phone, which is a nice feature.I bought this case mainly so I could wear it on my belt at work. The belt clip is poorly designed.  It will not hold firmly onto even a simple, thin leather dress belt.  The arm won't close onto it.  There is a protrusion that is part of the kickstand hinge that protrudes into the part where the belt goes, prevent it from closing completely over a standard belt.  A simple bump will knock this off your belt and onto the floor.  It does work on thin soft material, like a fanny pack strap, but not a belt. It's almost like no one even bothered to test it on an actual belt during the design phase.I typically have been very satisfied with Body Glove cases that I have bought, and I have owned several over the years.  This is the exception.  As a case only this works very well.

A2OK1J0FKAM6L,B003YJDZUQ,JWales,"[0, 0]","Like others, I have used many different brands of cell phone cases/covers. Regardless of price I invariably return to the Body Glove products for several reasons:1. They always have fit the model they claim to fit.2. Unlike other pre-molded products, Body Glove requires no break-in period. Fits properly right out of the box.3. Price point for other competitive items is always in between over-priced, unrealistically hyped products and cheap items that are made to fit a general size and not the actual product.4. Long lasting. I have never worn out a Body Glove case. I have broken more than one at its connection points but only when I exceed the recommended uses (usually extended batteries).5. For my tastes, the feel/grip of their cases feel solid and secure without adding excess bulk.This is my second Body Glove for the Droid X. I am somewhat OCD about dust and lint and my electronics so I tend to take my phone from the case often for a lint free cloth wipe down.On the Droid X model, it doesn't state it is compatible with the Motorola extended battery and cover plate but I bought my Droid X soon after release and it took this long for repeated snaps on and off to finally break a single securing/locking tab.Bear in mind, this is with the extended battery and while it does only add about 1.5 mm to the depth, the case is molded to fit the standard battery and cover. For this price point, if I can get months of use with an accessory not designed to fit and regularly taken on and off for cleaning, I have zero complaints.Highly recommend this item to any Droid X user.",5,Great value for the price,1308268800,"06 17, 2011"

Poor attention to details.

I'm not sure how long the snaps will hold up.  After putting the cover on with the belt clip attachment I noticed that when I touch my screen towards the middle I see that funny distortion bubble pop up on the screen breifly.  Well I figured the belt clip insert was to blame so I took the cover off and put in the plain insert.  Same thing occured.  I'm using the LS extended batteries with an original cover so I figured the cover insert was just too much so I took the case apart again and removed the insert completly.  When I snapped the case back together I noticed one of the clips was not holding already!  Yup just 2 dissasemblies and already the clips are failing.  To top it off the removal of the insert did not help with the distortion bubble (it only appears when you touch the middle of the screen).  Well at least the price was right and I will use the cover until it starts to fail (I give it about 2 months) or the distortion bubble annoys me too much.

I have tried many other types and brands of cases and was using the iFrogz brand before i found these.  They fit the phone nicely, are just ""sticky"" enough to not fall out of your hand while using, and are perfect for sliding in and out of your pants pocket without binding.  The holes on the back of the case allow for more heat to escape when using power-hungry apps like navigation and streaming.The only flaw, in my opinion, is the part of the case by the volume/silent switch.  The design leaves a thin strip of plastic along the edge closest to the screen.  In a vast majority of phone cases coming back to me for replacement, this is where it cracks first.  Some people live with it for a while until it starts getting annoying by binding on clothes or snaps off completly.All in all, 4 stars because of the fit, design, and price.

I don't usually put a cover on my phone so my rating is high.This stand is really small (1"" wide, 1-1/2"" long, 3/8"" tall), very lightweight, and fits the bottom of the phone snugly (but without pressure).  This all has its advantages because the stand does not cover the speaker or the microphone and it lifts the phone up just high enough over the desktop so that sound going in or out is not impeded.  The angle is perfect for video calling.  I use it frequently on normal calls with speakerphone on and voice clarity is excellent.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the phone inside the stand it is a little bit unstable because the stand is narrow (about 1 inch) and does not grip the phone (the phone just rests in it).  If the back part were a wider foot, for example, it would a bit more stable, but it would be more expensive as it wouldn't just be a single extruded piece.

It's also minimalist in that it doesn't come with a cable; you have to use your own iPhone connector cable.I'm all in favor of the first of those points, and I don't have any real objection to the second. What I dislike about this item is that it holds the iPhone straight up--perpendicular to the desktop (or whatever) it's placed on. Most cradles I've seen (dating back to my Palm III) put the handheld device at a backward-leaning angle. This angle is necessary to make it convenient to look at the screen of your device. The only time you'd want the device to be at a straight-up 90 degree angle is if it happens to be exactly at your eye level. Unless you keep your iPhone cradle on a 5-foot-high mantlepiece, or unless you're on your knees in front of your desk, it's not going to be at eye level. The second problem with holding the iPhone straight up like this is that the slot that holds the iPhone is at the front edge of the cradle. This means that the footprint of the cradle is almost entirely behind the iPhone. So it only takes the slightest nudge to tip the thing forward and knock it over. An iPhone is unlikely to come to any harm from being knocked over like this, but it's disconcerting and annoying.Give this thing a 20-or-so-degree angle and I'd like it.

There are three sizes of silicon covers, but I prefer the standard size. The silicon makes it very comfortable for running or relaxing, so they are very versitile. There is only one small problem and that is sometime the little silicon ear bud cover stays in my ear when I take the buds out (is rather humorous since it has gone unnoticed since they are so comfortable).The sound quality is quite good, they have a long enough cord, and all the buttons you need to control your iphone.

My left ear has a narrow ear canal, and no matter what I have tried, I can't get any earbud to stay in there regardless of whether I am running on the treadmill, or just sitting still.  I have tried several different brands that claim they stay in, but they don't.  So I gave up and started wearing headphones to work out with.  I won't have to do that anymore.  I can't say enough about how excited I am about this!The headphones I wear have a really good quality sound, so that gave me something to compare the sound quality of these earbuds to.  It is the same, which is awesome!  I turned up the volume as loud as it would go on my Ipod.  There was no distortion, and they were very loud, which means they have a great range of sound.  There is a volume control on the cord itself, which really comes in handy if you want to turn it down quickly so you can hear someone who starts talking to you.I ran on the treadmill and then walked at different speeds.  I did jumping jacks and jogged in place.  These earbuds seriously didn't move, not even slightly.I bought these for use with my Ipod.  That being said, I tried them out on my Droid phone.  They work well as a hands free option.  However, when I tapped the mic, nothing happened.  I would assume it is because they are compatible with Iphone specifically but I don`t know.  However, I don't care about that feature so I'm okay with it.  The phone calls that I made and received were clear.  To me, the sound was comparable to a Bluetooth unit.  These will be handy if I am puttering around the house and on the phone at the same time.  I have yet to find a Bluetooth that will stay in my ear, so these will work great for this purpose.They come with 3 different sizes, small, medium and large.  The medium size fits perfectly.  Not only do they fit well, but the earbuds are a soft, gel like material and are very comfortable.  I was able to slip them right into my ear easily on the first try.So, if you are like me and have tried every earbud out there with no luck finding one that just doesn't plop right out of your ear, you seriously have to give these a try.

They are tricky at how these stay in your ear. They don't go inside and create a sound proof enclosure. Somehow they get suspended in there and sound still leaks but that is fine since sweat will not touch the small speakers and cause them to fail. I sweat a lot and hate using headphones. They make me sweat even more. I love earphones but hate the fact that they come off or that sweat gets into the speakers and cause them to fail. Since these somehow get suspended in your ear they create ventilation and sweat doesn't get into the speakers. The ear buds can easily fall of since they are interchangeable. If you use the carrying case you will not have a problem losing an ear bud. I was just throwing these in my pocket without the case and as I take them out of my pocket the ear buds would fall off. These are great for making/receiving calls too. The sound quality is great and people on the other end tell me it sounds great too. I usually have to ask how the sound is on their end since they don't say anything bad. Usually people tell me if I am on a bluetooth or whatever since the quality is bad but not on these earphones.

A23GFTVIETX7DS,B0049SKIDI,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[2, 3]","These earbuds, while not the best sounding or the most noise-blocking of those I own, stayed in place, without budging during an hour long workout; however, as a hands-free set for the iPhone, they fail.First, the good:  the sound coming from my iPod or iPhone was pretty good, although outside noise was only minimally blocked.  I could hear cars approaching, which is a good thing for outdoor activities but not so great when you don't want to hear the treadmill or the TV across the room. When I first opened the package, I was skeptical that the sound quality would be good because the rubber covers have only a small opening at the bottom.  The cover is not flush with the earbuds, which means that the sound is funneled through the small opening instead of fully into your ears, the way in-ear sets work. And the covers are one-size only, so I was sure that my smaller ears would cause problems.  Not to worry! The resulting sound is not muffled, although not intense. either.  In other words, the sound is perfect for workouts or casual use, but not for dedicated listening.  The most amazing thing is that even though these don't fit tightly in the ear, they don't budge at all during physical activity.  They are comfortable to wear for long periods.There's a sliding volume control on the cord.  While the volume range is small, it's great for subtle adjustments when you can't easily get to your MP3 player/iPod.Next, the bad:  The most disappointing part of this Jabra set is the failure of the control box to work as an iPhone device.  You are supposed to tap it once to answer your phone, twice to skip tracks, and three times to ""rewind.""  When I click it, all it does it give a momentary burst of sound (this is NOT the volume control, either), no matter how many times I tap it.  It never answers my iPhone 4, even though the sound (ringing and voice, once manually answered) does get channeled into the ear buds.  As a hands-free iPhone device, it is close to useless.  Also, sometimes when I remove the ear buds, one or both gel covers stay in my ears.  This is annoying, especially if I don't realize it right away.

I always have high hopes though and the ear gel cover pieces seemed like a good idea. Plus being advertised as sweat proof and designed for active wear gave me hope they would be useful when out working in the barn. They were too big for my ears and as such caused some pain and pinching in one ear, so back to the actual tiny ""in the ear"" ear bud things it is. The gel covers only made the situation worse (for me) as it turned out and the things never sat properly long enough to make aa actual phone call, much less really get a feel for the sound production with regard to music. Lesson one - if you have small ears these are NOT FOR YOU.I passed them on to my nephew to try out so I could give a rounded review of the product on more than just the size. He used them in my Blackberry - they do not work well at all with the Blackberry Torch - loads of static on phone calls and feedback with music. However, in his iPod these Jabra active earsets were excellent. No feedback, no static at all and the volume button worked perfectly. The music was clear and crisp even while he was kicking a soccer ball around the yard. He liked the sound better with the gel covers than without and the earpieces fit his normal teen boy sized ears with no problems and no discomfort at all. He also liked the overall feel of the earpieces and the sound better than the set that came with his iPod. That's good enough for four stars in my book!",4,"Designed for larger ears, sound is good in iPod",1303862400,"04 27, 2011"

An interesting idea, the rubber part that cover the headphone design to wedge into your ear to make it stay. It is comfortable, I have no problem wearing it for extended time.However, one of the rubber part constantly came off and when I took the headphone off my ear, it stayed. I tried several time to put it back on the earbud, only to have it stuck in my ear again when I took the headset off.

AY1NUCXXJ5WD5,B0049SKIDI,Hummingbirds,"[0, 0]","I purchased this earset to hook to my Motorola Droid X phone, so I could listen to music when running. Well I just want to say it has an awesome sound!!! The frequency range is 17-22kHz which is pretty darn good! It did take a little while to figure out how to change the ear gels, and find the right one that fit my ear, and also to get adept at fitting it in. But the instructions were pretty good... it just takes a couple practices to get it right. I like that they don't go all the way into my ear canal.  The gels hold them securely by fitting to your ear cartilage, so they won't fall out. I tested this by running, and they stayed put! They also are sweatproof/waterproof, which is essential for a runner.I had someone call my phone while playing music. The Droid X paused the music and sent the ringtone and call through to the Jabra. The caller said that the mic sounded great. It has noise reduction (which Jabra is one of the best at accomplishing!), and the sound on both ends of the call was very clear! The mic is located on the wire close to your mouth, which really helps. I was really worried when I ordered these that they would not work well w/ the Motorola Droid X. But all the buttons work perfectly as they should. The volume slider works, and on the mic you just squeeze/click it to answer a call or mute the call, or to change songs.  To end a call you just hold the button longer on the mic. Very easy to operate!  I also ordered a pair of Motorola headphones, but am thinking of returning them (without ever even opening them) because I just love these Jabra ones!!! If you can find the perfect fitting gel out of the 3 sets they give you (and can position it to hold in your ear), I say go for these!

The design is good and the cords to not transmit noise to the earphone. I've had ones that transmit every jiggle and rub to the ear and these drive me up the bloody wall.I kind of like this design compared to the ones that have the small silicone plugs that fit in the ear canal.

ADLU9S36ZVD55,B0049SKIDI,Jason Mcvetta,"[0, 0]","This is the nicest cellphone headset I have owned.  The biggest feature is the unique shape.  Unlike most brands they are not round or ellipsoid.  Instead they are a much more complex shape that fits with the natural shape of the ear.  Definitely takes a little practice to master the skill of inserting them.  They don't just hook on like traditional designs, but rather must be inserted at a certain angle then twisted slightly.  One they're in, they fit perfectly - very comfortable, and don't fall out at all.Comes with three sizes of ear gel.  I found the medium one installed by default fit my (medium size) ears perfectly.Sound quality, both talking and listening, is great.  Mic (with integrated button) is attached to the left earpiece's cord, separate from the volume control which is attached to the shared cord.  When wearing the headset, the mic hangs near my cheek.  Friends report they can hear me better than on my previous (HTC & Apple brand) headsets, with less background noise.  Manual volume slider is a convenient feature for phones that don't support button-based volume control, and has just about the right level of resistance.Build quality seems similar to Apple brand headset.  I expect with my very heavy use it will probably last ~6mo.Includes a small rubber case.  Normally I don't care for the cases that come with headsets, but this one is simple & compact enough that I find myself using it all the time.Highly recommended.  Would not ever use a round-shaped headset again.UPDATE:  After six months of use, I lost my headset on the train.  It was still working perfectly - the little rubber case thing does a great job of keeping it from getting damaged in my pocket.  No question, best headset I have owned, I already miss it.

A2N75ADJSRW0AH,B0049SKIDI,Jeff Kraus,"[0, 0]","It seems clear to me that the audio quality of the buds is quite good.  Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to achieve anything near what they're capable of because they sit on the outside of the ear, and without that seal provided by some other buds, the bass reproduction is nonexistent.  They also have significant difficulty in drowning out ambient noise for exactly the same reason.  On planes and in noisy work environments, I have to turn the volume up significantly higher.  Of course, this makes the lack of bass all the more evident.On the other hand, the rubber earpieces are quite good.  They're comfortable over the long term, and though they feel like they're going to fall out, they won't unless you give the cables a tug.  My only complaint is that they don't stay on the buds as well as some.  They're held onto the buds with a tiny lip and nothing else, which may make them easy to put on, but it also means they come off easily.  On more than one occasion I've accidentally pulled on the cord, only  to have the bud come out of my ear, while the rubber earpiece stayed in.  And then at one point I had the headphones wrapped around my iPod, which I held in my hand while I boarded a plane.  By the time I got to my seat, one of the earpieces had fallen off the bud and disappeared forever.On the iPhone, the microphone works great, and on any device the inline volume control works as expected.  I'm not sure how useful it is since in all likelihood the device is right there, but it works fine.  These inline volume control boxes have been the point of failure of more than one pair of headphones in the past as the connection weakens, but I can't speak to long-term durability with these yet.",3,It's a bit of a mixed bag...,1306800000,"05 31, 2011"

I used them with my HTC Evo running Doubletwist to play MP3s.However, the oddly shaped pre-installed (and removable) ear gels are uncomfortable.

These are clearly meant to be work with the ear gels.  Even with the smaller ear gels on, I had a difficult time getting them to stay in my ears.The integrated controls and clothing clip are nice to have and the cord length is nice.  Speaking of the controls, I could never get the three-click rewind function to work.  All other functions worked fine.  The cord is thick, and this means you won't be able to hear the noise of the cord moving when you touch the cord (like some cheaper products).Again, these sound great.  They don't distort at loud volume (your mileage may vary depending on what you call loud) and I am hearing notes in songs that I never noticed before.But, they are uncomfortable even with the smallest ear gel covers, and it makes it difficult to recommend this unless you have huge ears.There is a nice on-wire volume control slider and track advance/pause button.The tubular packaging is unique with molded ears inside a tube.Overall, this is a product that works great but will need some getting used to if I plan to continue using them.",3,Quality Product But Uncomfotable in My Ears,1303862400,"04 27, 2011"

A2LXX47A0KMJVX,B0049SKIDI,M. Erb,"[0, 0]","I have literally  a drawer full of earbuds. Categorically they all pretty much fit terribly and sound about as good as they fit. Some of them are ""sound isolating"" which means they fit tightly in your ear canal, causing air pressure discomfort when you insert them and then as soon as you begin to sweat while working out, they slip out of your ear. Others are of the foam, ear-bud type that sort of fit in the outer part of your ear canal held in place only by the foam. They don't stay put, and since they stick out of your ear quite a bit, any air passing over them (as when riding a bike) causes a lot of air turbulence and noise making them virtually  useless for wearing while riding a bike. I don't have a single pair of them that I would call comfortable or of great sound quality at the same time.I was intrigued by the claims made by the Jabra ACTIVE earset. If these worked as claimed they would offer a great solution to what has been a long-standing problem with all the other earsets that I've tried.First of all, the packaging was pretty cool. The container is a clear cylinder and once you remove the top cap, you grab a plastic tab and pull the inside container out of the tube. It's very ingenious and immediately snapped me out of my indifference that I was experiencing of having to deal with what I was sure would be just another ill-fitting, poor sounding earset.Immediately I liked the feeling of the cord. It was very flexible and had a nice rubbery feeling to it whereas so many  other cords are more plastic-y and stiff. Then came the moment of truth, putting them in my ear. These are a bit different and they actually don't go in your ear as much as they fit ""over"" your ear canal, resting comfortably amongst the ear's cartilage protuberances. I'm sure there is a proper anatomical name for that, but I don't know what it is. I'll just call them ergonomically correct and very comfortable. You get your choice of small, medium or large  ear buds so you are likely to find a proper fit in one of them.Jabra does categorize these as sound isolating even though in the past I've found that designation apply to earbuds that fit inside the ear canal. Even though these aren't really inside the ear canal, the close ergonomic conformity to your outer ear does make them sound isolated to a certain degree. Certainly more so than just the foam ear buds.I found the sound quality very pleasing. It had a transparency of sound that was excellent. They lacked a deep bass but I actually prefer that to some of the stuffy, over-bassy sound that some earbuds produce. The sound with the Jabra ACTIVE was airy for lack of a better word.There is a handy volume control on the cord itself which is a sliding type as opposed to a rotary style. It has a short throw but was easy to adjust and I heard no static or scratching noise when adjusting the volume using that control.An added bonus to those of you that have compatible cell-phones or an iPhone is that there is also an inline microphone with integrated button in the cord as well. One click of the button will answer/end your call, 2 clicks will skip tracks and 3 clicks will rewind. Unfortunately my old LG flip-phone is not a compatible device and does not have the proper sized jack so I was not able to review the microphone/button for my review. Jabra does include a second plug in the package to fit certain phones that don't work with the primary plug.I'm really liking these earbuds. They feel very light and secure in my ear. The sound is superior to most others I've ever used.Finally, Jabra includes a handy little silicon sleeve that stores your earbuds when not in use. Other earbuds I've had  have come with a little zippered pouch that is just plain awkward to use. This sleeve, on the other hand is much easier to use and is a brilliantly simple solution to helping eliminate cord tangle when the buds are not in use.I could not be happier with the Jabra ACTIVE earbuds.

A4QXTN3K865NR,B004CZ7XWW,"aar! ""aar!""","[72, 80]","Having purchased the outstanding Altec Lansing iMT620 inMotion portable stereo system with FM Radio for my iPod Touch, I was anxious to try Altec Lansing MP450 Octive Stage speaker/docking station. As the manufacturer indicates it is a powerful, clear sound unit for an iPad.  A bonus is the system charges the iPad while docked - the stand pivots to portrait or landscape with multiple viewing angles for optimal comfort - just tilt the iPad for viewing or typing.  The speaker base is solid, yet not excessively heavy. The remote controller in iPod mode can be used to choose songs and videos from your library.  However, some buttons (i.e. MENU, BACK) only work with my iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 3GS. The sound quality is very good, in fact better than expected, especially when playing NetFlix movies. The unit is very compact 4.33H by 8.66W by 6.06D inches - it fits neatly in most places, even a lap table. The small remote allows you to change apps, tunes, adjust volume and according to the manufacturer is compatible with the all iPad, iPod and iPhone models. The MP450 works well with my iPad (WiFi), iPhone 4 and iPod Touch. It allows using non-docking portable audio or video device. I tried using my Pioneer GEX-XMp3 radio with excellent results - it has a 3.5mm auxiliary jack for hooking up other audio stuff. The speaker has a power button and volume control on the front,if you do not use the remote. I tried Altec's free Alarm Rock app for effect - wow what a neat feature.  The MP450 has a slick design, excellent sound, plus the ability to multi-task your apps. Bottom line - you can dock, charge, and play your iPad with ""no battery drain"".  Highly recommended this outstanding system.",5,A Must for iPad Owners,1292889600,"12 21, 2010"
A1R76R4E6A8S3B,B004CZ7XWW,Akash,"[2, 3]","It appears that all the other reviewers have covered the positive aspects of this unit but only a few came across one fatal flaw: You can't use this dock with an alarm app. The dock itself goes to sleep after a few minutes and apps can't wake it from that state meaning that if you were hoping to dock your iPad/iPod/iPhone bedside and wake up to a song, you'll be stuck with sounding coming from the internal speaker. This could just be an oversight but it may also be something slightly more sinister, does Altec Lansing perhaps have a clock dock in the works? Possibly.Also, as other reviewers have noticed, the sound quality isn't worthy of the pricetag.

Well, this is not really accomplished here because the audio quality is quite frankly on the level of that of twenty five buck PC speakers.  Now that wouldn't be a problem if the price was commensurate with the low quality sound.  But it's not.  Not in the nearest sense at all.  Oh, and if you say "" I don't mind the low quality clock radio sound"", well you can't use this as a clock radio either since the ipad wont wake up leaving you oversleeping and late for work.Frankly me for, sound quality is the foremost most important consideration so this device gets a very low mark on my watch.",2,Not very good sound quality,1298246400,"02 21, 2011"

It tilts so you can position the iPad in a portrait or landscape orientation without removing it from the stand.  As an added bonus, you can use it for more than just the iPad--we also use it for our regular MP3 player and it sounds great.  The only slight problem is that you can't adjust the height.

I can't imaging going back to the fold out case I was using to prop up my iPad before I got the MP450 Octive Stage. Altec Lansing has long been a provider of speaker docks for Apple iPods and iPhones, and the Octive Stage continues on in that tradition.I isn't that heavy at around 7 lbs. but it sturdy enough so that you won't worry about accidentally tipping it over. The arm is easily adjustable to get the best viewing angle, but has just the right amount of resistance to make it a great tool for working on the iPad while at your desk or on any surface for that matter. Much better than holding it in your lap or laying it flat. Rotating it from vertical to horizontal format is a snap. It has a clean, contemporary design that compliments the iPad nicely and does not draw too much attention to itself. The MP450 doubles as a charger which is an added bonus and should be a standard feature on all such devices. The control app installs easily (though MENU & BACK buttons don't work w/the iPad) and give some limited hands free control via the remote. It was made mainly for the iPad, so it looks a little silly when you dock an iPhone or iPod in it, but it does work well with them too. I tested it my friends' devices. Sound quality is very good for a dock this size and in this price range. It isn't top-notch quality, but I turned it all the way up while watching Iron Man II and while listening to base-heavy music and it performed well with little or no distortion.All is not perfect however. If you have some sort of case on your device, you won't be able to fit it in the dock. Tolerances are very tight to give it a snug fit with the iPad. This is a pain if you keep your device in a case when going mobile with it, especially for the iPhone or iPod. The stand arm is not height adjustable but in most cases the tilt screen arm should be adjustment enough. As mentioned, some remote buttons don't function with the iPod, but I expect a future firmware update will fix that. And again, while the sound is very good for what is, it won't blow your socks off.The Altec Lansing MP450 Octive Stage is a great charging speaker dock for portable Apple devices and it is getting A LOT of use from my iPad. If something unfortunate happened to it, I'd buy another without hesitation.UPDATE - 02/15/2012Just over a year of use and it is still operating wonderfully. I have read other reviews that stated the pivoting arm loosened and broke, but mine is still sturdy. I can only assume this issue is with a select number of units and not all of them. If you do have such a problem, I would contact Altec and/or Amazon immeadiately.",4,Can't live without it now!,1293580800,"12 29, 2010"

Well, a bit of a surprise for me, as the quality seems to be very good. The remote is small, functional, and feels solid. It should be backlit....that is my feeling about ANY remote. With that said, I love the remote! It's light, small, easy to use and perfectly functional. (Backlight would make it perfect).....Sound quality is pretty good, though not great. Don't turn it all the way, it just cannot handle it, and sounds terrible. Up to 75% volume, the sound is clean and not sharp. Bass is good for such a small dock. The Octiv Stage is a great value, and very versatile. It works great with the iPad, iPod, and iTouch. I do not have an iPhone, so I cannot comment on that. Do not look for an instruction manual. You are directed to their website for detailed instructions. As a typical guy, I tend to not read instructions unless I really have to....and luckily, I did not need them. The box has the basic instructions on it, and that isn't even necessary. The support for the i""anything"" is easy to use and set up and move. The entire dock is unobtrussive, yet stylish, though with anything but the iPad, it looks a little funny. The distance of the remote is more than adequate. I got about 20 feet away and it worked, but you do need line of sight, and anything in the way will block it from working. I do have to take off one full star for sound quality. You aren't going to rock out with this little dock, as it is best suited for desktop use. You also won't be happy streaming movies off of NetFlix and trying to listen to it in a noisy room. Again, on your desk, it would be fine, but not playing for a group. Please keep in mind that I am comparing the sound quality from my Harmon Kardon player, using my iTouch. There is no comparison between the two. The only problem is that the HK is not made for the iPad. Remember, I am comparing sound quality, and I think it is important to know what you are getting. Instantly, I could hear that the sound quality was not what it should be. Other than the sound, this is GREAT, and even with the not so stellar sound, it's a good value.  It's compact size lets you use it almost anywhere, kitchen, bedroom, nightstand, fireplace mantel, etc..

I have never seen charger that is so short, if you want something you can plug into the front of the car and use in the backseat, then this is not for you.Other than the short length of cable the other drawbacks appear to be durability and no brand name. I'm not sure I would peg this charger to last very long if you were moving it from vehicle to vehicle every day, staying put it should be fine but neither the plastic nor the cable itself seem to be very strong...I have a Fosmon case for my Lumia 1020 and it is excellent, seems to be top-notch. This charger however has no fosmon markings on it and I would bet money that it is a cheaply made generic charger, and that if I opened it up I would find shotty wiring at best.The key to this review is that Yes, this charger will charge your galaxy tab 2 7 inch, but don't think you're getting a brand name product...",3,"Bought for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7"" - Works, Short cable",1381190400,"10 8, 2013"

Unlike the United States, most countries do not allow phone companies to tie you into a contract for years.  You buy a SIM card (which looks sort of like an SD memory card), slip it into your phone, and it has your new phone number, and how many minutes are available, etc.  When ever I travel abroad, I carried my trusty Treo, switched out the SIM card in which ever country I was in, and had a ""local"" phone number, and rates which were much cheaper than my US cell phone company's international roaming rates.  I have switched to an iPhone, and so on my last trip, I decided to have it unlocked by Verizon (Yes, they will do it, although very reluctantly!), and figured I would then only have to maintain my contacts and appointments in one phone.  Unfortunately, I did not realize that the iPhone only takes MicroSIM card!  The good news is that the regular SIM cards can be cut down to MicroSIM card size, and they will still work!  The important information about your phone number, minutes, etc. are stored in the central portions with the gold contacts.  The only problem is that in most of the countries that I went to, they did not have ready made MicroSIM cards!  You could try and cut the card by hand with scissors, or even a knife, but if you crack the central portion, the card is shot.This is where this device comes in.  You place a regular SIM card in, press the cutter, and it cuts out the central portion, in the shape of a MicroSIM card in one shot!  Very neat!  Worked well.  The SIM adapters were an extra bonus.  If you need to use your MicroSIM in a regular SIM card slot phone (like my Treo), you slip the MicroSIM in the adapter, and then put the adapter in like a SIM, and you are back in business!The product is not fancy, but seems to be constructed well.  I would probably use it a couple times a year.  I don't know if it would put up with daily use (for example, if you were doing SIM to MicroSIM conversion as a business).  Came in a generic box, but packaged well.  Delivery was prompt, as per schedule.  The price is much cheaper than most other similar items (Range: $19.99 to $29.99).  Also cheaper than finding and paying someone to do this for you (most SIM sellers in foreign countries will do this for you, if you ask; sometimes for free, sometimes for a price).If you travel abroad often, and have an unlocked MicroSIM Card (GSM) phone, this should be a ""must carry"" item in your baggage.",5,Just works!,1346112000,"08 28, 2012"

However, the Mini SIM card itself shifts back and forth 1 millimeter or so within the puncher which could potentially result in a slightly offset Micro SIM punch.  Seeing as how the SIM card's metal contacts themselves are only about a millimeter wide, not sure if a millimeter shift in either direction would cause misalignment issues within the phone's slot.  I have one SIM and didn't want to find out, so I used a Googled image of a standard Micro SIM to align mine within the slot so that the proportions on either side of the metal contacts looked about right.Aside from that, it's a very solid metal construction and seems pretty well made.

A26FD4U2SMC52A,B004I58ZVY,ruel,"[60, 64]","Bought this Micro SIM Cutter from Amazon marketplace third-party seller Eforcity. It works. You can read all the reviews for this and the other cutters that are being sold here on Amazon where some people seem to complain about their troubles with cutting their SIM cards into a Micro SIM. However, I think what this all comes down to is whether you are comfortable cutting up your SIM card into a Micro SIM card and whether your SIM card has a gold chip on the card that won't get chopped up by the cutter. From my looking at my old SIM cards for different phones and also looking at pictures of different SIM cards, it looks to me that if the SIM card is an older SIM card, then the chances are the gold chip on the card may be larger in size and therefore the greater the chance that the cutter may chop into it and may possibly render a non-workable SIM for you. If you have a spare SIM card that has the same size chip as on your working SIM card, then try cutting that as practice to see if you can cut the card evenly, and to see if the gold chip is not chopped into, and to also see what the now converted Micro SIM looks like as a result and comparing that result to pictures of actual working Micro SIM cards. Others have complained about how their cutter may not have cut smoothly around the card and had to be trimmed around the edges. I didn't have a problem with that. For me, the cutter cut the SIM nicely and converted it into a Micro SIM that worked fine on my iPhone. If you want to feel more confident about how you are cutting the card, you may want to hold the SIM card in place with your finger at the end on the SIM when the SIM is in the cutter to make sure for yourself that it cuts around the gold chip and that the SIM card doesn't slip out when cutting it. The other complaint that people have are about those sim adapters that came with the cutter. I consider those sim adapters to be ""bonuses"" that are probably never going to get used. If need be, I'm just saving the cut-out frame from the old SIM card for if I want to reinsert and tape the Micro SIM back to its former self as a full-size SIM card for use on my other phone.",5,Micro SIM Cutter works great,1339200000,"06 09, 2012"

The actual screen protector that is advertised is really really good. I ordered these and loved them. I later ordered some more and didn't get the same screen protector that is advertised here. The 5 Pack Crystal clear 6400 are great if you get them. They fit perfect and are very clear and smooth. I end up getting some different screen protectors than the ones advertised the second time around like I was saying. I got a 6 pack of the worst screen protectors probably available. I'm not sure about the brand name because no name was on them, but they completely sucked. These screen protectors were way to big for the phone so you have to cut them down which is almost impossible to without jacking them all up. I don't think it's possible to apply these without at least 10 air bubbles and I couldn't get them out. I never used a screen protector that collected so much oil from the skin, it was a grease trap. I had to wipe off the thing every time I even touched it. I finally got pissed and just removed the screen protector from phone and ordered some different ones and roughed it for a couple days without protection, yes these are that bad. If you get a six pack RUN.....I took a photo, the red package on the left is the first order I got. The picture on the right is the second order I got.

A2PZXXPGLXXKZU,B0054NUFPS,AK529,"[0, 0]","I've been wanting to get this case for a while now, but just wasn't sure I would like it. I finally decided to try it because of all the good reviews.  It's a great case overall with a lot of added protection.  Before this case I was using the incipio ngp case. The case mate makes it much easier to press the power button and use the volume rocker on the sensation. On my incipio it was always hit or miss on being able to press power and volume buttons. The case mate also has a nice textured feel that makes it much easier to grip the phone and your less likely to drop your phone. This case is easy to slide in and out of your pocket.Now on to the negative or not so great things about this case. This case does add bulk and extra weight to the phone. When comparing the bulk the incipio case adds this one is not that much more. The case mate also takes alot longer to take off and put on. With the incipio I could take the case off or put it on in under 10 seconds. The case mate takes atleast a minute to put back on and it's not an easy process. First you put on the silicone skin part and line it up correctly. Then line it up with the hard case component and finally after the two are put together you go around all the corners and make sure there all flush. Taking off the case is a fairly quick process. In my case I do swap out extra batteries so the putting the case on does take longer. But if you don't ever take the case this won't affect you at all. I paid $35 for my case. I do see it's selling now for about $18. Which is more reasonable for a phone that been on the market for a year now. And the fact the case doesn't come with any extras like a screen protector or port covers. In the end this case has superior build quality and is worth every penny even at $35. The only question is how it will hold up over time. Hopefully it will last atleast 6 months.  I will update this review over time after more usage.One more thing I forgot to mention this case didn't come with any documentation on how best to put the case on and off. The process is not exactly self explanatory. Personally I was ok but I am sure others may have difficulties with it. At this price point I expect better support and documentation.",4,Great protection for HTC Sensation,1342137600,"07 13, 2012"

Well, the $10 one came in a nice tin box - that I don't know what to do with - and had a two-inch tether that clipped into the earphone jack with a piece of plastic. Otherwise, they're the same. These work just as well, maybe because they're the same!

These are very pretty, well-made, and downright cheap compared to the Samsung stylus which is $19.99 each and only comes in black!  However, when these arrived I had already been using the Samsung stylus and found several differences that seem to justify the $19.99 price tag for the Samsung.1.  The Samsung stylus is smaller in diameter.  I have small hands with arthritis and found pink ones to be more cumbersome.2.  The Samsung stylus is heavier and appears weighted differently which makes it easier to hold onto. For some reason the pink ones keep falling out of my hand.  I think because they are so light-weight.3.  The Samsung stylus is about 1/2"" longer which gives you more of a feeling of holding a pen or pencil.4.  The cushioned pad on the end is very smooth of the Samsung stylus and glides effortlessly over the screen which I have a screen protector on.  This ones pad is a bit rough and catches on the screen in comparison.  It is also flatter and wider than the Samsung stylus.I sent two of these to my daughter to use on her touch screen phone.  The others I put away in case my Samsung Stylus breaks for some reason.  However, I just ordered an extra Samsung Stylus because I don't want to be without one.UPDATE: My Samsung stylus tip came off after three months and I started with my backup Samsung stylus which lasted less than two days before the tip fell off.  (Seems from the reviews others are having this problem as well.)  Having no alternative I dug out these stylus to use until I ordered another Samsung.  The first one of these lasted about three days and the entire end came unglued and fell out.  Then I started with another one.  It has been over a week and it is working just fine.  I have become accustomed to the smaller size of the barrel and the wider tip.  I just reordered these instead of the Samsung Stylus.

A2IVQ43O59LDYT,B005EPNSKK,Michael T. Boschert,"[0, 0]","My first impressions of this device is I am glad I purchased this for home use! I think for vehicle application it probably has a niche as it would be better suited for dash installation as the arm is quite short as the device specs state.  I did want a short reach cradle as I am using this as a desktop application. I bought a ceramic, smooth tile, felted the bottom and suctioned the cradle on. For that it is perfect.However, in either application I am weary of the design of the clip. Check out the ample pics from a previous buyer, the slide contraption relies on a slide and rail with a spring for torque. At rest the opening is just at 2"", may be a hair less.I am using a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Elago Slim Fit case and it measures 2 7/8"" together. This is the absolute max opening of the dock! So it just fits. Lose the case and you gain maybe a 1/16th of an inch. Removing the spring from the cradle (very simple to do) and the opening slides to 3 1/4""! So it has the room, it is just the spring is too long/too or too tight. The spring is very stiff, so if you are up from some tinkering, you can stretch it out, cut to length and the cradle may indeed be adequate to suit your needs.At stock setting, getting the phone in is not so bad, there are no finger rests to squeeze the slide down the rail to open the grips; getting it out is another story. Since the slide is at max opening already one has to squeeze the last 1/2 mm out of the spring and slide the phone down and out of the grips. In a car I would see this near impossible with the steering wheel in the way.Even with the case off, I would say nearly impossible to tilt or twist and pull the phone out, at least not in a manner that makes you feel comfortable doing it, so it is still best to slide the phone out from the bottom. One thing to note is the opposite side of the slide and rail setup is stationary. The plastic is hard so no flex there.Another complaint is that the grips are pretty deep so accessing the screen you are forced to come straight in instead of slightly at an angle. In a vehicle this may be an issue, for me and my application, I just twist the coaster contraption I made.While the dock/cradle is able to rotate at 360 degrees, it takes some force to do it. Your device definitely won't lose it's position, but I fear trying to adjust the angle will wear out the ball and joint tension prematurely or just break in the process. As stated by others it takes some good force to snap it in to begin with.For my vehicle I use the Kensington Quick-Release Car Mount. It is made for the iPhone's but works on other models. I have used a Droid Razr, Droid Razr Maxx and now the S3. The S3 is defintely the tightest fit, still more wiggle room than the Arkon being reviewed. A friend uses the S4 with Otterbox Defender. It fit until he tried taking it out, then broke it, so at least you know the limits.I highly recommend that car mount, it has easy one hand in and out operation, as both sides are spring loaded in a chip-clip style, the grips do not obstruct and it has 180 degree range of motion with click stops, so it can be tailored to your liking. A long adjustable arm, and good suction.At the time of writing the Kensington is twice the price as the Arkon being reviewed, so I guess the old adage is true...you get what you pay for.IMO: I think the manufactuers are still trying to keep these devices universal, but since the average screen size is now 4.5"" for a smartphone the width is a bit more, especially when adding a case.You could ask why I didn't buy a charging dock instead? Because this was cheaper, would hold the phone, and I don't have to have it on charge all the time...and I'm cheap.That's my 2 cents and unlike the guy from the Dos Equis commercial, mine may actually cost you money!",2,Home Dock,1378771200,"09 10, 2013"

With this in mind, this case is good - as in decent - but not the complete quality job I was expecting from Body Glove.  It needs to have more grip to it; previous Body Glove cases I've owned for other phones were more ""grippy"".  This one is smooth but certainly better than no case at all.  It adds little bulk to the overall device and I like that.  So trade offs are what they are.  It's minimalistic but quality built in all other respects; the velvet like inner-liner is a nice touch; the kick-stand is functional and nicely integrated - I've not found it hard to use at all, contrary to what others have said; the case provides just enough edge to the front so you can set the phone down, screen facing downward, without worry.  I carry my phone in my pocket and this case keeps the in and out action smooth.  I switch between this case and the Ballistic depending on my activities; both cases go on and come off quick enough that it's no biggie to switch it up.  When I need rugged, I go Ballistic.  For everyday use - this case rocks!

A2RI4QE6EO29CA,B005OKBLRC,J. F. Hindy,"[31, 32]","Okay, let me start out by saying my review is not affected by the shipping (that's a seller rating, not a product rating).On to the review.If you're buying a case for your phone so it'll survive a plane crash, then this is not the case you want to buy. You'll want a Trident or an Otterbox for that kind of protection. This is the kind of case you buy for it's big feature: the kick stand.Before I get there, about the case itself. It's textured a little bit on the back which helps with grip a little bit (I thought it was just a design), which is nice. The inside of the case is fabric, which is also a nice feature so it won't just pile up dust. The case fits like the name implies, a glove, and there's no wobble or looseness about it. It pops on easily and is removed easily. there are cutouts for the camera, power button and volume rocker and they look good. Deep enough to protect them against things like a fall, but shallow enough to not impede usability. No worries about hitting your camera on a table or something. The front of the case extends passed the screen, so you can safely lay your phone face down if you should need to without scratching the screen. The speaker is also cut out, so it does not impede any sound coming from them (be it from music or speaker phone).The kick stand is incredibly nice. I used to own an HTC Evo 4g and when I upgraded, I missed my kickstand dearly. The one on this works three ways. You can put it in landscape position both ways (with the volume rockers up or with the power button up, your choice) and it can sit very securely in portrait mode. The kick stand itself looks and feels durable. It is also backed up by a support piece of plastic for extra stabilization. I saw some reviewers say that it takes a pen or something to pop out the kickstand. The first few times this is true, but once you spend a few days and ""wear it in"", the kick stand clicks in and out of place with ease. I've had it for almost a week and I can say, with certainty, that it is not that difficult. For those who are thinking of purchasing this to make their Epic Touch feel like their old Evo, this is the case you're looking for.The only con of this case is that the top and bottom spinds are cut out completely (where the charging cable and 3.5mm headphone jacks are). So if you drop this and it lands on the top or the bottom end, the case might as well not even be there. However, as I stated earlier, this case does not cater to the ""I need my phone to survive a baseball bat"" demographic, so I subtracted no stars for this. If it's dropping on a corner or flat on it's back, the case will protect the phone, though.Lastly, let's discuss the name real quick. It is kinda messed up that Body Glove put ""Epic 4g Touch and Galaxy S II"" in the title of their case. However, anyone with a little sense can easily tell this is NOT for the European SGS II. If you look at the picture, the camera cutout supports a vertical camera/flash layout. The SGS II has a horizontal camera/flash layout. So don't buy this if you have the regular Samsung Galaxy S II, because it WILL NOT FIT. If you want a kickstand and have the original SGS II, then you can check this out:http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Pop-Cases-Stand/dp/B0057G0SBS/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid;=1326654046&sr;=8-10That WILL fit your phone. This will NOT. Caps lock for emphasis, not yelling :)All in all this case is marvelous. Despite the misnomer that this is a 'case', it really feels like more of an add-on or an attachment that provides a little bit of extra protection, a little class (the design is quite nice) and, above all else, a kickstand. I no longer miss my HTC Evo 4g :)",5,A good case if you're buying it for the right reason.,1326585600,"01 15, 2012"

A2VAW1CN0U364J,B005OKBLRC,Tino,"[0, 0]",As one reviewer put it and I agree. It depends on what you are looking for. This is probably not the best case to protect your phone from dropping it on the ground. Although it does help in that area. This case will best suit those looking for a built in kick stand for their Epic 4G Touch and it does a great job of it too. I love that it can be used in three positions. It can stand the phone upright or on either side. This case works great for me. It also makes the phone feel better in your hand and gives it enough grip so that it doesn't feel like it is going to slip and fall.

Unfortunately the top and bottom of the phone is not protected at all.  So a fall in that are will damage or scratch ur device.  Also dust and dirt tends to collect where the cover meets the phone.  Overall, this is a nice cover for medium protection and the stand.However, after having it for only 2 weeks, the coating on the case started wearing off.  It becomes this residue that gets caught between the case and the phone.  Now the case is not attractive anymore.  The stand is of mediocre quality.  It works, with some nudging.

Be very careful to not get the liquid into the area around the button. I also used my tweezer and my fingernail to scratch off the sticky stuff once the alcohol had made it a little easier. It is tedius. You don't have to do this though if you are just putting on another sticker, only if taking it off permanently for a while.",5,Love these!,1361750400,"02 25, 2013"

A31LIHR7QZ71TD,B005XJ17XC,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]","GTMax 5 pc Stylus Pen Set with Memory Card Case.Pros:  These stylus pens are handy little items to have for those small keypads on phones and touch Kindles.  I have used one on my Acer Iconia A500 tablet, one on my Kindle Touch, and one on my Motorola Atrix 4G phone.  What I like about them is that they have a small attachment that plugs right into the headphone socket so that you won't lose them.  Of course, if you're just buying them for the Kindle Touch, I found that a regular rubber eraser works just as well (such as on an electronic lead pencil)Cons:  There's only one thing that I don't like about them.  At first I thought the rubber was too hard, but have now come to realize that whatever is under the rubber that activates the screen on touch devices is not as sensitive as the larger stylus pens.  You have to press a little bit harder, which makes it easier to mis-type on the keyboard.  But, when you get used to using a little extra pressure, everything goes okay.The memory card case is really cheap and I probably won't even use it - and can't figure out why they even included it.

Putting this case on, you'll find that it fits perfectly around the phone. It fits easily, without actually falling out when you don't want it to. There is also a lifting edge around the screen, so that it doesn't contact the surface you set it on (I think this is pretty standard now).The one gripe I have is that the microphone, next to the usb charging port, is partially covered by the case. This is nothing a razor can't fix, but it's disappointing that it wasn't engineered perfectly!The reason I switched to this case from the D30 was because of the buttons, they were covered by the D30 and not easy to press. Cutouts are a huge plus and make the phone feel a lot easier and funner to use. However, when compared to the D30, the Diztronic feels a bit flimsy and lacking in the protection area.All in all, I like the case, especially for the price! But I may try keep looking as new cases come out (Incipio looks promising).**** EDIT 1/6/2012Changing to 5-star because they listened and made the hole on the bottom of the phone bigger to make room for the microphone.

A3Q3DCVDKZHRRW,B005YEFM8M,Yoft,"[0, 0]","For the unaware, TPU is a material that is essentially a blend between plastic hard cases and soft silicone cases.  It's flexible like silicone, but it's smooth like plastic.  The fit is great, it has perfectly cut openings for both the top and bottom mic holes and all the buttons are easily accessible.  I'm guessing that the reviews that say that the case covers the mic or has incorrect cuts is for the first revision, but with this current revision (revision 2) I can confirm that all the holes are cut perfectly.As for the utility of the case, it depends on what you're looking for.  It will serve perfectly fine in preventing your phone from getting scratched or dinged, but since it's less ""gel"" like than silicone and leans more towards plastic in that respect, it's impact resistance I would imagine is pretty low.  If you drop your phone on concrete, expect a lot of shock to course through your phone (which might not actually damage it, but certainly has the potential to) but your phone will emerge scratch free from the drop.  The benefit of having a slicker/harder surface than silicone is that it doesn't stretch (it is flexible enough to apply, but won't stretch permanently like silicone if you play with it too much) and it will slide in and out of your pocket with ease.  I always avoid silicone cases because they stretch and catch on the inside of my pocket.Overall a great fitting case and if it fits your needs (read: if you don't drop your phone from large heights often) it will do the job.  Only slight issue I have with the case is cosmetic, with this color (matte black) the front half is glossy while the back half is matte.  Presumably it looks that way to match the glossy glass of the front better, but I'm personally not a huge fan of glossy in general, and certainly not such an obtrusive color change halfway through the case.",5,Great Case,1330560000,"03 01, 2012"

It looked and felt cheap and did not seem to add much in the way of protection for the phone other than to protect it from surface scratches. I wanted something that I could use to protect the phone even in poor weather from wind to wet conditions and give the phone a chance to survive being dropped onto a hard surface. After reading the reviews I figured this case was a good bet but reluctantly bought the case after one other failed purchase. Well it is better than I expected in both protection and looks.The case has two shells for protection. The inner shell is made of a soft plastic or rubber like material that is close to the original case in terms of protection, but has more of a cushioning effect. The hard outer shell provides a second layer of protection being a hard plastic shell that seems ideal shock protection. So the inner shell that acts like a cushion, you put the two together and the outer shell takes abrasions and shock giving one great case. In addition there are covers that fit tightly over each opening on the phone and the volume toggle, and the on off button work easier with this case than without, since they've incorporated harder rubber like nodes over those buttons that make each of those controls much easier to use and access. The nice surprise was the case really enhances the looks of the phone on top of everything else. The phone almost looks like a weather proof camera with this case on. It does add some bulk but for the level of protect and looks it's well worth the minor inconvenience. There is one more thing about this case that is note worthy and that is that it goes on and comes off the phone easily, in fact easier than you might think given the amount of protection that it provides.Over all this is a great buy, it adds a high level of protection, is easy to put on and take off your phone, and adds to the look of a great phone.

The Ballistic is hard to pull out in a hurry because of it's size. I started looking around for something almost as good but not as bulky and the Trident Aegis is the case I found that fits the bill.The Aegis has the same double layer protection like the Ballistic and the Otterbox but without the bulk. It has the solid bumpers on the corners and a hard shell protecting the rest of the phone. One thing that I personally don't like about the case are the flaps for the USB/HDMI and headphone jacks. They aren't really that necessary. The Ballistic doesn't have them and the Otterbox flaps are floppy and don't shut well, the Aegis's flaps actually stay closed and look nice and neat.One of my main concerns I have is that the rubber rim around the face of the screen is not that thick so if you drop it on an uneven surface of if it falls face first on a little piece of dirt your screen has a better chance of breaking than the two other cases. That is the only feature I would really want to change.Overall this is the best designed case for the Bionic and I definitely am happy with it.

Also, Make sure your device is supported for MHL per the device user guide.Now for the details.Brand New GS2 for t-mobile. It displays the image on the screen, only, not in full HD. The video playback is a little choppy/ pixelated and does not display in the proper resolution. But if you have to use this feature for just regular internet browsing, or using the phone for making word docs and stuff (basic small office), then you can should be fine.I think the issue for the resolution not displaying properly is b/c it maybe the output from the phone. For example, when encoding video, you have the option to encode it in it's proper aspect ratio or, having the video stored in animorphic mode in which the video is squeezed purposely to save video size and it is up to the decoding media to convert the aspect ratio for you.With that said, the fix for the aspect ratio issue is to set my tv manually to 16x9 instead of auto.So in a nutshell, I like it, I can deal with the little pixelation, not a problem, It works as intended. And as far as the side cable input for charging the batt, that should not be an issue b/c most tv's have usb ports on the sides or in the back. So in a sense, your tv will power everything.Update: Did a second check for the aspect ratio and turns out, it was the netflix app. When I play a video saved on the phone, it shows correctly without changing the resolution. Also, it was not as choppy. So its app specific on the quality you can get from the output.",4,GS 2 t-mobile,1372636800,"07 01, 2013"

AXS5VWLUSQDPQ,B006FTKM12,Jake,"[19, 23]","When I bought this on Amazon back in January 2012, it was just $4.99. It performed as well, if not better, than the other MHL adapters I bought, even though it was the least expensive. I wound up keeping this one and sending the others back.One problem that all the MHL adapters had with my Verizon Galaxy Nexus is that occassionally the video would flicker, like the connection was lost for a second. I don't know if the problem is with the adapters, MHL technology in general, or with the phone. Anyway, the problem seems to have sorted itself out, as I have had great reliability the last several times I've used it. Here's what I do to increase reliability:I reboot the phone, turn off sync, and put it in airplane mode before using the MHL. I do this just to make sure that all of the phone's resources can be dedicated to sending video though MHL, without other stuff running in the background stealing resources. Also, I don't want my video to be interrupted by a notification of email or whatever.In the past I used the USB port of my TV to supply power to the MHL adapter. Although it worked for my particualr Samsung HDTV, I think I get better results by using a regulard microUSB charger that plugs into the power outlet. Make sure it's a good quality charger. I have a cheap one I bought on Amazon from a third party, and it didnt' work well with the MHL adapter.One thing I noticed about this MHL adapter compared to the others I tested is that the femail micro USB port on the side of the adapter was more recessed on this one, which meant that I needed a charger cable with a long male plug. Otherwise, it had a flimsy connection. My samsung charger would wiggle when plugged into this adapter. My old Motorola microUSB chargers were perfect; they went in deep and held firmly.Overall, I think this was a good buy for me.",4,Works,1340064000,"06 19, 2012"

It wasn't for the lack of chargers, I have a ton of those but just look at it, how awesome can he be?  His arms move, eye's light up and they actually change color depending on the cycle of charge.  I saw it and clicked add to cart 2X!Here are the specs of this little guy:1. Eyes light up: (charging) Blue (standby) White.2. Andru can stand on his own two feet! Comes with his own stand.3. Input: 120 ~ 240v AC, Output: 5V/1A DC.4. Andru Dimensions: 2.5""5. Moveable arms and flexible antennae.6. Green & white plastic.A lot of people in the reviews I have read are having issues with the brightness of Andrus eyes as they light up when you plug it in.  I suppose if it is next to your bed it may but I have never had that issue, call it a night light (another benefit).  Build quality is outstanding for Andru, durable & flexible plastic he is no doubt built to last.  He also comes with his own Micro USB cable but you can also use your own of various lengths.Andru is also multi purpose, not only will he charge your phone but in my case he charges my Galaxy S3, Note3, Kindle Fire, all 3 of my Kindle e-ink readers & lastly my Akron External Battery Pack. Adru is a 1 amp charger so no doubt he will charge anything you throw at it, he certainly hasnt let me down.Attached are product shots so you can see how Cool Andru is:1.[...]2.[...]3.[...]4.[...]",5,"Great charger, conversation piece, show your support!",1389225600,"01 09, 2014"

Here are the cons you drop this with your phone this case will absorb the impact but it will take a hit all the jewels plus gold rim will be chipped. Speaking of the bling it comes off very easily from just normal use of the phone from either the impact of setting on a surface. If you have your phone inside your purse notice the gems would just come out of place.

He agrees that the protection it provides the all-important touch screen is a good thing and he's telling me that he is going to keep the Vita inside the case but he hoped for some fall protection.So, here are the good features enumerated:- When in 'closed' position, the screen is protected from scratches- The touch-sensitive back is always exposed making it unnecessary to take your Vita out of the case when playing.- All buttons and ports can be easily accessed- The Vita easily snaps into the case and stays there (easy installation)- Can be folded as a stand when watching a video or making a video callAs for the not so good features:- No fall protection, already mentioned twice- The glossy finish seems to collect all fingerprints and make them highly visible- Adds weight- Adds bulkI agree with my kid on the 3 stars which, by the way, are not a 'bad' rating. 3 stars on Amazon's scale means ""it's Okay"" which is in between ""I like it"" (4 stars) and ""I don't like it"" (2 stars).",3,Screen protection,1337904000,"05 25, 2012"
A2IKMRNKQ12ZPT,B006WJ6YGW,"Amazon.Buyer ""Never argue with an 1d10t...the...","[1, 2]","Ive looked at a lot of cases for portable consoles and this one is really great. It protects the screen when you are not using it by folding over the Vita and has a padded cover and when you need to play the case opens up and works as a sunshield to block unwanted light and reflections. The rear touchpad is exposed to allow using all the features of the Vita without having to remove the case and the same applies for all the openings to charge, insert headphones or use the Cameras. The only downside is that in order to change a game you have to remove the vita from the case (same applies if you want to insert or remove the memory card but less likely). This isn't a major drawback but a slightly better design could have avoided this. This case is great for me to carry the Vita around without a bulky padded case but of course is not for drop protection. If you want/need that there is a nerf case but it makes the Vita huge. The rear screen is also alway exposed so that may be a concern for some about scratches on that touch screen. But those wont be visible during use so they aren't as much a concern as scratches on the LCD which you will have to look at constantly while using the Vita. Overall, exactly what I was looking for, just wish they had designed it so I don't have to remove the case when switching games.",5,Exactly the case I needed.,1332460800,"03 23, 2012"

I had two choices the silicone case or this one. So far the Face cover looks nice with glossy plastic but feels a like cheap.

The power button, volume buttons, L/R, charge port, headphone jack, and memory card slot aren't blocked and easy to access.

A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B006WJ6YGW,T. Paslay,"[0, 1]","I was a little skeptical of this case based on the price. I wanted a little more protection for my Vita, but I didn't want a bulky zipper case and the floppy Sony case that just hangs off the Vita is just altogether unappealing. This HORI case seemed like it had the most potential.They should really call it a case, not a face cover. This is a full clam-shell case that encases, mostly, the entire system. All the ports are still available as this is meant to be a semi-permanent enclosure. There is plenty room surrounding each port so as not to inhibit normal use. The shoulder buttons are left exposed as they really don't need protecting. The rear touch pads and camera are left exposed but, because of the thickness of the case, you could slide it across abrasive surfaces without either pad or camera making contact with anything harmful. Installation is as easy as snapping the Vita into the base. The fit is very snug and you can shake it around without worry of your Vita becoming airborne.The design of the case is very sleek. The polished black surface matches the finish of the Vita flawlessly. The plastic isn't industrial grade, but it's at least as solid as a cell phone case. The thickness is just right, it's not overly bulky and actually makes the Vita a little more comfortable in my large hands. There's a piece of sturdy foam on the inside of the cover to protect the screen from any loose debris.There are only a few minor issues I have with this case. Personally I don't like the DS-esque flap that is connected to the system while you are playing. Second, the hinge at the top of the case makes an already bulky system a little bit more-so. Lastly the clasp is fixed plastic that works based on tension. I would've preferred a more secure locking mechanism. Honestly, it will probably never be an issue, just a concern. All of these issues are very minor complaints and definitely shouldn't dissuade you from a purchase.Ultimately, this is a solid case that doesn't make your system look cheap. If you're in the market for a Vita case but don't want the bulky zipper bags, this is easily the best thing available.",5,Surpisingly well done for an affordable price.,1337990400,"05 26, 2012"

AF03NDXR2PIFX,B006ZD5V46,B. Wilson,"[0, 0]","This Rockbed case for the iPhone 4 or 4S is a nice, hard plastic case. I like the way it feels and looks. Up until this point I had been using a soft rubber Otter case. One thing I like about the Rockbed case is that I can quickly pull it out of the front pocket of my jeans, whereas the Otter sticks inside my pocket and feels like it is going to pull my pocket inside-out.There are a few things I don't care for with the Rokbed:1) It does not come with a screen protector2) There is a non-stick pad on the back. Testing out the non-stick pad, I put my iPhone on the dash of my car and in about 5 miles of straight driving my phone fell off the dash. (Yes, the Rokbed came with a car mount, but I haven't mounted it yet.) Also, when I have my phone resting on a hard surface and I'm pressing the center button or typing keys on the left or right edge of the keyboard, the phone tends to rock a bit because of the non-stick pad.3) The case design makes it a bit difficult to press the buttons on the side. This may not be a problem if you have long fingernails, but I find it difficult to adjust the volume or take a picture using the side buttons. Same for the button on the top of the iPhone.I haven't had a problem (yet) with the case coming apart but I can see that it might happen. There are two small plastic protrusions (see the picture I uploaded) that are approximately 0.01"" in height, and those are basically what keeps the lower and upper parts of the case from separating.  I would note that the case comes with a lanyard, and the lanyard connects through holes in the lower and upper parts of the case. So using the lanyard would most likely prevent the lower and upper parts of the case from entirely separating.",3,"Nice case for the iPhone 4 or 4S, but a few shortcomings",1347926400,"09 18, 2012"

But, based on the reviews of the Rokbed case, I figured I might be able to get similar protection with less bulk.  I was very wrong.  First, the case slides together with very a little locking mechanism to keep it together, which, if you dont use the lanyard, allows it to come apart in your pocket.  Second, there is no screen protection layer, so if it is dropped face down, you are pretty much guaranteed to crack the screen.  Next, the universal mounting system it comes with uses 3M VHB (very high bond) tape to hold it on something.  That is fine if you dont want the mounting system to come off and moved to some other place.  And lastly, the cost of the accessories out weighs the cost of getting another Otterbox from Amazon.  About the only thing I liked about the case is that there are a number of accessories that we could use for it, but those do not sufficiently protect my phone from damage.

I've had probably 10 different cases for my iPhone 4. I had one case for my 2G, 3G and 3Gs, but the boxy form factor of the iPhone 4 has made finding a suitable case somewhat troublesome as they all tend to exaggerate the squareness and create a brick in my pocket.A Brief Introduction to My Experience with Rokform Products:A few months ago, I bought the original Rokform Aluminum case (the one you put together with tiny screws). I absolutely loved it, except for one large flaw. It severely impeded my reception. I live in a rural area and sometimes only have 2-3 bars. With the aluminum case on there, I would drop calls several times a day and my signal was extremely weak. In my house where I have a very strong WiFi signal as well as a 3G MicroCell Tower, the load times were horrible, no matter which one I used (3G or WiFi).Fortunately, I was able to part with my Aluminum Rokform case at only a slight loss via the great online auction site. When I saw the new aluminum cases with the poly-carbonate bottom half, I got excited and was thinking that may have solved the antenna issues. Reluctant to drop another $80 on an aluminum case, I waited and saw the Rokbed V3. Bingo! A poly-carbonate case with the style, durability and Made-In-USA approach that I appreciate from Rokform.My Review of the Rokbed V3:I received the RBV3 today (thanks Amazon Prime!). It snapped on the phone easily and looks great. It's not super bulky and fits in my (slim) jeans pocket nicely. My co-worker liked it enough that she ordered a pink one. This case is great. I've got 4 bars of reception here at my office with full Wi-Fi signal. With the Aluminum, I'd have one or two bars and 2 bars of Wi-Fi signal. This is good. The case fits snugly and works well with a screen protector on. No bubbling on the edges or interference at all. All of the buttons and ports are readily accessible and my Bose In-Ears work wonderfully with the generous spacing around the headphone port. I also appreciate the small indentation at the top near the sleep/power button as it makes getting to it just slightly easier with the pad of my finger (as opposed to the tip). The same is true for the volume rockers. I can easily adjust the volume using the pad of my finger or thumb while talking without having to alter my grip on the phone. All good things, yes?While I love this case and I did point out some of my favorite attributes, there are a couple of issues with it that make it slightly less than perfect and cost Rokform a star on this one. Both of the issues I have are attributed to the Remote Mounting System (RMS). While I appreciate the system and I can see the plethora of add-ons that Rokform could run with, it's a bit unnecessary in my opinion. First, when I originally opened the package and got the phone in the case, I snapped the RMS onto the case. Bad idea. It took me quite some time to get it off. I ended up putting my phone under one foot and using both hands to twist the RMS off the back of the case. What this tells me is:A) There is no way the adhesive will stand up to the amount of torque required to remove the phone from the RMS, andB) If the super-strong RMS glue does break away due to said torque requirement, it's probably going to mar the dashboard of my car or at least leave an ugly glue stain.I can't say for sure, but In my opinion, it shouldn't have been anywhere near that hard to remove the RMS from the back of the phone. Maybe it will loosen up, but I'm scared to put it back on there. Also, the RMS makes the case far more bulky than its previous aluminum counterpart. I wish Rokform made a version of this case that wasn't compatible with the RMS so that they could retain a much slimmer form factor while offering the styling and strength of the original Rokform offerings. Give me a Rokbed V4 without the ability to use the RMS and I'm sold 1000% Until then, I'll make do with the V3 as I think it is a superb case for the money.On Rokform's website, they offer customization options that allow you to choose a top color, a bottom color and a rubber grippy-thing color. It's a $10 upgrade but one that might be worth it if you're looking for something extra-special for your phone. Also, if you're a fan of the RMS or you want to use it for something other than mounting, they make bottle openers and pocket clips that snap on and look pretty good.All-in-all, this case impressed me and it'll stay on the phone for quite some time. I tend to get bored of cases fairly easily, but I think this one is exciting enough to keep me happy for a while. Thanks for reading. Feel free to post comments and questions and I'll respond as soon as I can.********************UPDATE 8/20/12********************Another member pointed out my ""prejudgement"" of the RMS feature of this case. I don't feel that I prejudged it, but perhaps judged it a little too soon. After my initial experience of trying to get the thing off the phone, I decided not to use it. I did go back and revisit the RMS and I attached it to the phone and removed it several times (probably 15-20, realistically). It loosened up some. I then attached the RMS receiver to my car dash and used it for a while. My iPhone is done (not because of this case) so I've switched to a different phone for the time being. I tried to remove the RMS receiver from my dash and it isn't going to happen anytime in the next 500 years or so. I don't know what adhesive they use, but you could build a bridge with it. That's a good thing because it requires a fairly significant amount of torque to get the phone on and off of the receiver.Keep this in mind when you decide to stick your RMS receiver to the dashboard. Once it's there, it's there for good. You'll sell the car with it on there and so will the owner after you and the one after that. I'd be surprised if it ever came off. The car will probably go to the junk yard with that thing on there.I love Rokform (still) and I love their customer service. They make innovative products with the end-user in mind. I'd buy from them in a heartbeat should I ever return to the iPlatform.Hope this review and this update clarifies any questions anyone had about the long-term performance of the case.",4,Found My (Nearly) Perfect iPhone Case,1335312000,"04 25, 2012"

The outside plastic case is about the same but it does not fit quite a flush on the sides into the sleeve.  The openings line up well on the 4S.  The charging port flap does not seat well.  For a third of the price this is not a bad case and should protect the phone from the small knocks and bumps of daily use.  It is slim and slides easily in and out of my pocket.  Overall it does the job of protecting the phone with a relatively small profile.

The mount is made of plastic, which makes it strong but light. In the hand, it has a solid feel, nice and sturdy.The mount is great, it can be attached on the windshield or dashboard, and most others only have one choice. If you prefer to use the windshield as I did, this makes your phone similar to a GPS. Just firmly press the sticky suction cup onto the window, pull the lever to activate the super holding force, and insert your phone.If you like the dashboard over the windshield, there is can be done. I achieved better results on the smooth surface of the glass versus the textured surface of the dashboard. The adhesive gel pad is made by 3M who are known for great products.The fact that the mount can accept a wide range of phones is great, it even holds my Note 2, which even surprised me. The ball and socket joint gives the option of turning the phone ""360 Degrees"", now you can put it where you want it. If the suction cup is not holding as good as it once was.

The wire in the back of the bear in the suppose fake product is ok but it is kind of to bendy, so it dosent look as nice as the real product, because I also own the real product, but in a diffrent color. The real product comes in a cardboard box that is pink and white but the fake product dosent. While taking a picture of the fake case, the tail fell off.

I'm so amazed and I didn't think it could be better than I expected. It's so much bigger and fluffier than I thought it'd be and it's so much more adorable. My likes out weigh my dislikes. I only dislike the tail and the wire frame that holds the phone inside. I feel like the tail could fall off after a while of useage and the frame won't hold my phone right. It slides down after a while but as long as it doesn't fall out i'm fine with it. Another slight complant is that hes a little patchy but it's unnoticeable unless your hawk eyeing it. Anyway I still love it and it's my favorite phone case ever.I gave it five stars because I do indeed love it and it's really amazing.I saw a girl on Instagram that has one but hers is brown and at the time she said it was thirty dollars.

I was okay with the discount.It didn't come with an instruction manual or a quick start guide. I was a total newb with these things so I had no idea what blue meant or what red meant. lol! I could assume red meant it wasn't charged, but you know what they say about the word ass/u/me. It turns out that red does mean battery is not fully charged and blue is fully charged. In any case, it would have been nice to have something that told you in the container it came in.The connection is problematic and there is simply no way around it. It doesn't always connect properly, actually, I'm not sure it ever connects properly first try, but that doesn't mean the thing doesn't work. You just have to play with it bit, wiggle it, put a piece of paper at the bottom of the battery (the one without the connectors) and so forth.I must also make an annoyance note here. I have come across a red light when the thing wasn't actually charging. The light sensor (not the charging connector) is obviously slightly defective, which is truly an annoyance. Just check on it after a couple of hours and if it's not charged, take it out and try again. That's the best I can offer.The pros are of course price and that it DOES work, once you get the battery going. I boughtthese batteries (3 of them)as backups and they all charge to 100% with this charger. They also last just as long as the native battery that came with my phone too. This is proof that the charger really is a good buy, so long as you make sure it's connected properly, which as a reminder isn't always easy.It really only loses one star due to the connection and the light because it does work and it fully charges the battery, so that's what actually matters most to me.",4,Works if you play with it a bit.,1371513600,"06 18, 2013"

Bending it back to make or take a call doesn't bother me except for the fact that my cards are facing out making it a little obvious this would be a great steal. I would have given it five stars but for two little annoyances... First, the bookmark tab doesn't do an excellent job of keeping the phone all tucked into the case. The phone slides a bit more than I would like. I don't think I'd want velcro to hold it in, though. Maybe if the tab were a little longer to tuck in. Second, my bills fit folded but tops of the bills stick out a tiny bit to where they overlap one of the folds. Maybe this wasn't made with US currency in mind? Finally, there's nothing to be done about this, but I'm a lefty so I generally hold my phone with the home button on the left when landscape.

But one thing has been frustrating (and maybe someone here has a suggestion).  Something about the leather ""strap"" that holds the top of the phone in the case messes with the iPhone 4S face proximity sensor.  So when I bring the phone up to my face to make or answer a call, I sometimes accidentally enable the mute button with my cheek - which shouldn't happen because of the proximity sensor.  Also, after I bring the phone away from my face, it often doesn't sense this - and keeps the screen black/locked.  Not a deal-breaker - because I don't use my iPhone for calls very much.  But keep this in mind.  Otherwise, the leather is very nice quality - and I get a lot of positive comments on it.

More like eyeliner size.  For guys, about the size of a mini Maglite.  It's a solid device, that for sure, offering the same feel as a quality flashlight.  Speaking of flashlight, the single LED built into the tip is a pretty bright.  While I don't have a light meter to measure how much light it emits, it's a fairly impressive amount.  When the unit is fully charged, I found that it would run the flashlight for over 8hrs in a go.After draining and charging it several times, I found that the battery pack would take about 4 hours to charge up from totally empty, using a 2A AC adapter.  Compared to my HTC One, which has close to the same size battery, that is roughly twice the time to charge.  Looking closely, the difference is that the HTC ships with a 2A AC adapter (same one used for this testing), which would indicate that the phone will absorb up to 2A while charging.  The lipstick battery on the other hand is limited to 1A input, which is half that of the phone.  And that solves the question on why it takes so long to charge: half the input power, double the time it takes to charge.This charge rate becomes rather important when it comes to the unit charging up other devices.  Each of the devices listed above come with a 2A AC adapter.  The lipstick battery pack however has a maximum output of 1A.  Again, half the output, which results in twice the time to charge up the other device.  And if your device is on, there is a chance that it will eat up most of the incoming power instead of storing it.  On each of the devices I tested with, I found that each barely made double digit increases in charge over a one hour period if the device was on.  Worth stating however is that though the devices didn't get much of a charge over the hour, it's another hour the device was able to be used as well.  It's still a pity that the lipstick battery doesn't have a 2A output though, and that in and of itself is why I took off a star.In summary, I think it's definitely worth the asking price (currently 15 dollars), even though I could wish for the higher output.  It is supposed to be a backup battery that is small in size and convenient for toting around. In those respects it does well.  I'll be attaching this one to someone's keychain, though one could use the little velvety bag that comes with it to hold the adapter cables.",4,Some pretty bright lips,1375833600,"08 07, 2013"

Having no way of telling if the bank is still near full or empty is bad.Slipping an inexpensive 7/8"" plastic or rubber cap from your local hardware over the end will keep dirt out of the contacts and stop false activation.When charging my Kindle keyboard (which wants to charge at .85A), it can supply only .70A at 4.20V which is a large voltage drop for a power bank.  Some tablets like my ASUS limit their charging current to a 4.75V input, so it would be a slow charging process.  For phones with small displays or MP3 players it should charge fine.",3,Works fine!

A1WU99RI2DTTJZ,B007WO5LF6,"Steven M. Mcmahon ""deal hunter""","[27, 34]","I purchased one of these from a different manufacturer on Amazon some months back, and was very impressed. So I purchased 2 more since my partner asked for one as well. This is a versatile, convenient flashlight, but what's really cool about it is that it's also a charger for your smartphone or tablet. Now this isn't going to get you through a week in the wilderness, but it is going to get you through the day if you , like most of us, have a smartphone that you use some much that the battery drains on you. Most of us have to tether our smartphone to the desk or near an outlet to charge it. But with this you can just plug any USB cord into the end of the flashlight and charge it up on the go. When you get home at night recharge the flashlight's battery and you're ready to go.The light  itself is pretty powerful. We sometimes walk for exercise at night, and in South Florida it's pretty dark, some of the streets don't have street lighting, and using it as a flashlight is convenient. It's a nice compact size for a flashlight and having this around is really a wonderful tool for anybody who needs a portable recharge available for their smartphone. Also this is easier than bringing a smartphone's cord and the part that plugs into the wall. With this you just need the cord part. Most smartphones and tablets have a cord that unplugs from the part that goes into the outlet. So instead of carrying that I'm happy to carry this instead. I don't think the brand matters too much. The other brand was a bit more money but has a little blue led on the opposite end from the flashlight, where the USB and micro USB are. I guess that would be convenient for getting one's keys out at night, but that's about it. In any case, between the two of us we now have 3 of these and they are extremely handy.",5,The Most Useful Charger Ever!,1373587200,"07 12, 2013"

Wonderful design. 2. Great quality solar cells. 3. Compact. The bad side: The battery is NOT what is claimed. It claims 2 ampere hour, 2ah. I have a laboratory computerized battery tester. After I first cycled the batteries three times after receipt I again charged the two I bought in full sun all day. Then I ran the battery test. On one the battery read .85 aH, or only 42.5% of its rated 2.0 aH. The second one did better at 1.37 aH or 68.5% of what it was supped to do. I phoned the actual seller and asked them if they had newer stock that might have batteries that came closer to what is being advertised. They phoned me back and told me that they did not and for me to return these for a refund. They were not interested in the results of my testing. I'll return these for two more and see how the replacements perform. I will post again to report my findings. Now, my honest opinion is that even at 50% of rated specs on the battery I STILL think it is worth the price I paid for it. I just wanted people to know that you will not get the battery life you are paying for if that is of importance to you. I don't imagine most people will calculate the current drain of their cell against the available power remaining in the battery of this item. Certainly worth the money for an emergency.

The FREE pen I saw the other day would allow you to use it as a pen or a stylus. The cap that had the stylus would reattach to the body of the pen. This pen won't.

A36MQY2HNRIA2W,B008589XF2,Larkhall,"[1, 1]",This armband seems big but the Samsung Galaxy S3 is a somewhat large cell phone so it fits appropriately. I've managed to squeeze my S3 with its Otterbox on into the Belkin.  It's a little tight but better than having to remove the protective case for when I'm walking or on the elliptical.,4,Belkin armband Samsung Galaxy S3,1363824000,"03 21, 2013"
A35LT14WG5BX0T,B008589XF2,Lola Bunny,"[3, 3]","I've used armbands in the past for previous phones but never for a phone this large, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. The Belkin EaseFit Plus Armband earns my respect for securely holding my S3 without adding an unnecessary amount of bulkiness to an already large device.Pros:Lightweight: the case is made of a combination of neoprene and flexible plastic and weighs approximately 1.5oz.Phone fit: The first time I slid my phone into the armband I wasn't thrilled with how tight the fit was and the fact that my side buttons were being mashed as they passed through the slot. However, after using the armband a few times I've since mastered the art of inserting and removing the phone and it seems to have broken in just enough so that my side buttons are no longer getting mashed. Once inserted, the phone fits securely in the pouch and stays in place.Also in regard to phone fit, I like that after inserting and removing my phone from this armband multiple times my screen protector has not been disturbed. I had feared that with the curvature of the S3's face the corners of my screen protector might catch and begin to peel up from the screen but so far, so good.Responsiveness: The viewing window doesn't sit exactly flush against the phone (I suppose if it did the phone would be very difficult to insert/remove) but despite this I was shocked by how responsive the screen still is. Swiping and tapping the screen works surprisingly well through the plastic window of the armband.Comfortable: The slight stretch to the neoprene band offers a snug fit while still allowing some give for arm movement/muscle flex. The Galaxy S3 is a big phone and feels somewhat cumbersome on my small arm but this case does a great job of minimizing that as much as reasonably possible.Adjustable: The strap can be adjusted from approximately 10.5"" to 14.5"" which offers a perfect fit for me.Cons:Key pouch: This is a nice little feature that I was excited about as I typically just take my phone and house key when I go out biking/running. At 1"" wide the key slot holds a standard 3/4""-7/8"" wide key just fine, but is not large enough for my personal house key which measures approx. 1.25"" wide. Although the band is made from a stretchable neoprene, the front of the case is made from a flexible plastic which really does not stretch so the pouch cannot accommodate a larger key. It's also worth mentioning since the product description talks about using the pouch for a car key as well that my Ford car key won't fit in the pouch either. If your key doesn't measure 1"" wide or less it's not going to fit in this pouch.Accessibility to phone buttons: It would have been nice if the case had some definition on the sides for the side buttons. Trying to guess through the plastic front where the volume buttons are is annoying.Gap in top opening: When the phone is inserted there's a gap in the neoprene (see customer images). This is disappointing to me as it sometimes starts to rain while I'm outside and I want my phone to be fully protected. The gap does expose the headphone jack which may be handy for some but I would prefer the option of completely closing the top of the slot when the headphone jack is not in use.Conclusion:It's not without its flaws but the benefits of this product far outweigh the few minor gripes I have. Overall I'm pleased with this armband and look forward to using it in the summer months.",4,Not perfect but not bad!,1362700800,"03 08, 2013"

Predictably,  Belkin didn't reinvent the wheel; nor was there any need for it to do so. The armband keeps the phone safe and sound and mostly accessible. I say ""mostly"" because the clear plastic does hobble the touch screen. This problem is not much of an issue when using a earpiece or headset to make and receive calls and listen to music. However, if you need to tap the touchscreen while on the run, you will find, as should be expected, that the screen is not as responsive as it is outside of the band.If you are looking for an armband for your Galaxy, definitely consider this Belkin. However, when thinking about using any armband with the S3, you have to consider that the S3 is a big phone. I had my wife wear it so I could judge the band's looks. My first impression was that the S3 seemed really big strapped to my wife's arm. My second and third impressions were the same.

I have had my phone dropped several times and the worst thing that has happened is that the kickstand pin got lost and I had to use duct tape to reconnect the kickstand. I have owned a few of these and the only part that has ever broken was the kickstand pin. I now just use tape to connect it and it works great to protect my phone. I have had a few aftermarket Chargers and a couple of headphone jacks that would not plug into the phone with this cover installed because the plastic around the connecting holes for these items was a bit tight for the connections to be made. I have modified the cover slightly to allow for a better connection of these aftermarket chargers and headphones. If it were not for these slightly tight holes I would have given it 5 stars instead of four and the fix is very simple to make with a razor knife.

AJP45EYVBQSTP,B008APGRFY,Mark W. Dickson,"[0, 0]","I purchased this case as an alternative to the otterbox as I don't always need all that heft and protection so I didn't want to spend a lot of money.Pros:The kickstand is a nice feature, pretty solid, though still plastic and should be treated as such.The case is very solid, fits snugly around the phone (phone doesn't slide around like some other cheap cases).The rubber piece provides good protection all around and covers the side buttons, headphone jack and charge ports.The deep ridge around the screen does a good job at protecting it from drops.The side button covers push the actual buttons very nicely and easily.  I have had problems with other cases being too stiff.Cons:The high lip around the screen can make sidebar navigation or swype typing difficult.  It also makes it relatively annoying to push the menu, home and back buttons along the bottom.Not very comfortable to hold to your face with phone calls and prevents you from getting your ear right on the earpiece.One of the biggest problems I have with this case is that the plastic well around the headphone jack can prevent some thicker plugs from being inserted. Very annoying.Other Thoughts:The case is a bit hefty and bulky for my tastes, but I was expecting that.The rubber (like all rubber cases) picks up all dust, dirt and lint.The case is very tight on the phone which makes it difficult to remove.  I find this to be desired while I have the case on as it won't come undone if you drop the phone, but if you switch cases a lot, you may want to keep looking.Final Impression:The case is very durable and holds the phone well.  Kickstand is great, cameras, flashes and speakers are not obscured.  Ridges around the screen are bound to annoy many people, especially if you have fingernails that would get in the way with the direction it forces your finger into for certain things. The headphone jack is a big downer, I had to buy a new ""slim plug"" cord for my car stereo aux jack and it won't work with my Audio Technica headphones due to the plug size.

My intent had been to save this for long weekends, or traveling, or power outages (coming off of the Sandy weekend) but it's really nice to not have to even think about my battery.Does it add bulk? Yes. That's going to happen with any extended battery right now. One thing to keep in mind, you'll get some shadowing on pictures when you use the flash b/c of the thickness on the back.

It states you have to completely charge this battery, leave it on charge for 12 hours. Then drain the battery completely, and charge it completely, 4-5 times. With a battery that lasts EASILY 1 1/2 days on a single charge, conditioning is tricky, especially if you dont have access to an outlet all the time (my job).

So now I'm just using the YESOOTPU cover to hold the battery in place. I didn't even grab it hard and it sounded like it snapped in half butreally the cover just has a crack near the mini usb port spot.. As I said before, its just pure garbage plastic.But the battery is still working phenomenal.I've ordered the Hyperion 7000mAh battery as I am giving this one to my brother =). This battery is great butit's not reaching my expectations given that I'm always watching Netflix, listening to high quality 256 - 320kbps music, Daily sync, Facebook, Reading books and watching streamed TV all on 4GLTE / 40% brightness andsync on. By the end of the day ( 14 hours usage ) I'm down to 15 - 25% battery which I don't want consideringthat full charging a battery starts at around 5-20% and it's always resetting my battery stats because of it.But its really phenomenal because if I leave the phone alone ( Usually on my days off 90% of the time not touched )it'll last ~2-4 days depending. ( When device is off on specific days, I've set it up so it will completely go intoDeep Sleep + Airplane mode + Sync On + Wifi On + Greenify Auto Hibernation + Brightness 10% + Processor Power Saving Mode@ 384 - 810, OnDemand - Deadline. )I would still recommend this product if you're a mild device user ( Internet Browsing, GPS, Call / Messaging, Social Hub Networks )and if you guys have any problems, do not and I will repeat, DO NOT HESITATE to call Hyperion CS ( Customer Service ), or live web chatCS. If you have any problems, they will help you with what ever it is you are troubled with.Thanks Hyperion, your battery is still awesomely insane!---OLD REVIEW:Just bought the battery and I can already tell it'll be great and it'll last a long time just like my old iAnker 4400 mAh.I never really follow battery calibration and charging instructions. Even though you need to charge it for the phone to""recognize the break-in period"" I still would think overcharging as well as too many ""full charge cycles"" reduces the lifespanof the battery, I've owned a few extended batteries and they've lasted me well within 1-2 years before they actually start losinghours and mAh on charges, and this is without doing their calibration instructions.The backplate feels cheaply made, its not like the original devices backplate where it's really flexible and it won't breakunless you intended to break it. This backplate however just feels like its all pure garbage plastic and even at a small flex or bendit'll look like it's going to break or crack.The 2 pegs in the middle on the left side don't snap in, if you'll look closely at it, there's a gap and putting your fingernailbetween the gap will pop the backplate right off so i'm a little more careful not to grip to tightly ( And my device is really slipperyin my hands, so I'm always gripping tight :&lt; ).Every time when I press the home button while holding the bottom part of the device, it'll make a plastic grinding sound betweenthe device and the backplate like there's a small amount of space inside that's not secure.I've ordered a YESOO extended cover but that won't come until next week. Hopefully it will hold the backplate with the device.Until then, this review will be updated some time later.",4,"Great Battery, Weird backplate.",1402099200,"06 07, 2014"
A3FR7J48O0EPKJ,B008BVIV06,"Christopher T. Owens ""revbones""","[2, 2]","Just got this and everything else I ordered and since I had gone a different route than some I wanted to put the information up.I previously had a Seidio Active case and loved it.  Good protection and I can still access the full screen area.  Unfortunately the Seidio extended battery is only 3500mah and $75 (with NFC).Seidio does make an Active case for their extended battery.  I saw a lot of people using TPU/hybrid cases, etc... which I have tried before but while offering good protection, covers enough of the screen edge and/or rises enough off the screen to prevent me from easily accessing the back or menu functions - and I don't have fat fingers either.I ordered the Seidio Active Extended case along with the the Hyperion battery but it will only fit without the Hyperion battery door/cover - but I found out even though the Seidio website doesn't offer it, you can call Seidio and order just the battery door for their extended battery for $14.95 which fits the Hyperion battery perfectly and allows you to use the Seidio Active Extended Battery Case.  Unlike some of the complaints about the Hyperion battery door, the tunnel area isn't there on the Seidio case, and I can zoom in or out with the camera and don't show any of it.  It's also slightly rubberized, so even if you didn't go with the Active case, it provides a better feel than the slick feel of the Hyperion (and is more grippy) - but doesn't grab pocket lint.Currently charging fort he first 12 hour charge now, will update with stats after some usage.***Update***I was curious about the note that comes with the battery that recommends at least a 12 hour initial charge and then a full discharge and charge 4-5 times to achieve peak performance so I emailed Hyperion about this since I thought it might just be a holdover from previous battery types continuing the myth.  There is a lot of confusion regarding battery memory and performance as some previous truths no longer hold water.  This is a Lithium Ion (Li-ion or Lib) battery which does not have a battery memory.  NiCd batteries did have a memory. Like NiMH batteries, Li-ion's have no memory and can be topped off as needed without affecting battery life.In fact, fully discharging a Li-ion battery is akin to running your car at 95mph vs 55mph, it's stressed more and things will wear out much quicker.  Li-ion's prefer a shallow charge so topping it off regularly without letting it drop will actually increase battery life. At best you would only need to fully discharge a battery to calibrate the 'fuel gauge' on a smart battery.  Continuing on Li-ion's not having a memory effect, their life is based more on discharge cycles, with shallower cycles taking less of a toll on the battery's life.Anyway, Hyperion emailed back and agreed that only the initial 12+ hour charge was necessary and that despite the card with the battery, that there was no need to discharge it completely.It's been a few days now and the battery is fantastic!  I have incredibly poor reception at my house, so after 3-4 hours off the charger, I would be down below 60% as it would constantly seek service.  I was off for over 4 hours and only down to 97%.  I tested it while out this week by running a streaming stock app with over 20 stocks being updated in realtime, checking email, browsing the web, running a flash-based chat room client, checking a high-frequency message board for about 2 hours over 4G and I was only down to 93%.  I had enough stuff going on and switching back and forth that I got it a little warm (barely noticeable), so I feel that I was pushing it quite a lot.  So, quite happy with this battery - just don't forget to get the Seidio Active extended case and battery door.  That makes all the difference.**** Update #2I should note that the case I was referring to was for a Samsung Galaxy S3.",5,Little thicker/heavier but a lot more battery,1355097600,"12 10, 2012"

I've got something unique to add too!I got my battery and it worked well - until I took a picture that used the flash. Whenever I took a flash/picture the phone would go to a black screen, from which I couldn't recover unless I pulled the battery. This was very reproducible. No one on the Internets seemed to have the direct problem but someone, somewhere (thank you!) said something that led me to try replacing the battery with the stock battery - that worked fine. Additionally - I discovered that with the extended battery I *could* take a picture using flash if I put the phone in airplane mode first. I was able to cycle through these scenarios enough to prove to myself that it was the battery and so I shot off a quick email to Hyperion and with nothing more than a quick, short email describing my problem - they immediately sent a replacement out, requesting only that I discard the one that was defective! This continued the story of amazing service and that amazing service is bumping up the rating from a 3 to a 4,I've got the replacement now and it seems to be working fine - no flash issues for certain! The battery itself does allow me to get through the day without having to worry about charging the phone (with the stock battery I'd run out sometime in the evening - before dark) ... anyway - no worries about making it until bed time now and I can even be a little more generous about using it than I had been before. Sometimes I think it can last TWO days but I don't see that happening (and this is primarily what is holding me back from giving it five stars because I had my fingers crossed for that).Anyway - a word about the bulky size of it ... I am not one to care about the size of the phone but it is noticeably deeper and heavier, dramatically so. When you add a case on top of it, it almost makes you think twice about the whole concept of an extended battery but what good is the phone if its got no charge?

I then did repeatable battery drain tests using a battery logger application and an app called 'Fast Discharge' (wifi, bluetooth, gps, and cpu enabled. no screen, vibrator, or flash) for all three, and the stock battery...from 100% to 5%.The Onite battery and the Hyperion both get 5 hours of runtime on the dot, the QCell 4:30, and stock gets 2:45.The battery lasts 81% longer than stock, and stock is 2100mAh, so I would estimate the battery is roughly 3800mAh (see below for more details).  It also has NFC, and I like the back plate.  It seems flexible enough to absorb shock without breaking, but it looks like others have a different experience.  It is the exact same back plate as the one that comes with the QCell battery.I peeled back the label on the battery and I see that the battery is identified as ""SWB495060AR/12F25001.""  Googling the 495060AR will get you some results, but unfortunately details are hard to come by.I also did a test with a CBA-III and the battery was tested at 4223mAh, which is actually above its stated capacity.  The graph is in the customer images.I compared the thickness of the phone with a Galaxy Nexus, and it's only a millimeter or two thicker than the Nexus, so that's a good comparison phone.It has unsurpassed (but matched by Onite) run time, has a decent back plate, and a good price.

I bought the white honeycomb case, and it's just horrible really.  It is almost impossible to press the power and volume buttons with that case.

When my son's Galaxy SIII was starting to have battery issues and I ordered the 4200mAh replacement for him.  Like all of their products, the 4200mAh extended battery adds some bulk to the phone as expected.  The battery is the size of the stock battery with a much larger battery piggy backing on it.  It adds noticeable size and weight, but all of the larger batteries do.The included case is nice looking but the surface is smooth. It makes the back of the phone a little slippery but the extra size and weight actually help in this regard.  The cutouts are all perfectly aligned and nothing was forgotten.  It snapped on firmly and feels like a factory fit.  The only down side to the case is that it doesn't come around the sides like the TPU covers other manufactures provide.  This means that if your phone falls face down it will not have any extra protection on the screen side.  In addition, with the extra thickness, finding a protective case is nearly impossible.  If you prefer a phone with no cover or you like screen protectors this won't be an issue.  Otherwise, adding a screen protector becomes necessary.The performance of this battery is on par with other Hyperion products.  It allows my son's phone to last all day from early in the morning until late at night without a recharge.  If you need a battery that will last your throughout the day without a boost, you need to look at the Hyperion battery.  It took his tired SIII and gave it new life. He went from looking for plugs all day to not needing anything, even on long days with heavy gaming and daily usage.Pros: unbelievable battery life and a professional finishCons: weight and bulk, no front side protection for the phone and slippery finish.",5,A great extended battery for SIII phones,1400544000,"05 20, 2014"

Slipped my phone out of its case, removed the back, swapped the batteries, put the new included back on, put it in the new case, and that was all. Simple as pie. The result is a little bulkier (a little moreso still due to the case), but it's still fairly lightweight and not hard to grip or carry by any means, and it fits in my pockets about as well as before.Performancewise, I'm not 100% sure it's operating at a full advertised 4,200 MAh. That should be exactly twice the power of the OEM 2,100 MAh battery, but I don't know that it's getting that far. An 8 hour workday of moderate use would often leave me down at around 30% battery (70% used). With this, it's more around 50%. That's still not bad, by any means. It's a marked improvement for fairly little investment or inconvenience, and in an emergency I've got the original battery around to pop in. This IS after doing 4-5 complete power drains and recharges as recommended by the included instructions (though some people argue this isn't helpful - I just wanted to do it by-the-book).All told, while I'm not sure I'm quite getting the full doubling of power (on anecdotal evidence rather than any objective tests), I'm still getting a lot further than I used to on this battery, enough to justify the investment.

I purchased it on January 18, 2013 so I've had it about six weeks.First, the good news:The silicone part fits well.  Its purpose seems to be as a cushion for the hard case (which makes sense).  If you intend to use the hard case to completely enclose the phone and to holster it onto your belt (or what have you) it will provide adequate protection for you.  I've used it for this purpose a time or two and for this reason I gave it two stars.and then the bad news:If you intend to have the case only on the back of the phone so you can use the phone, this item will not provide the protection you need.  It is solid, however, the corners of the case do not wrap far enough around the phone to hold it in place.  It slides off - not completely - but enough so I don't have confidence it would protect the phone in the event of even a minor fall.  Also, if you intend to pull the phone out of the holster quickly enough to answer a call you will be disappointed.

All of the side buttons work with the gel case on and there are handy hole covers that appear to be fairly well made and thought out.The kick stand works to lay the phone on its side to watch video's, movies etc...The belt clip on the holster also pulls out into a kickstand held in place by a rigid wire.I can not figure out why they put a kickstand on the holster though because the phone will only fit into the holster one way with the screen facing the felt backing. I am not sure why you would want to use a kickstand to see the back of the phone.Overall, I believe this is a good item and well worth the money. One note is that with a little persuading, like getting into a car, the holster will release from the belt clip. It will snap right back on but the first time it happened to me, I though I might have broken the holster.I have not done any real drop tests, so I can not speak to the protection factor for the phone.

It features textured finger pads on the back and sides of the case. It is a dual layered case, with a hard exterior shell, and a softer shock-absorbent interior. Like all Speck cases, there is a soft rubberized bumper on each corner, and a rubberized cover over all the buttons. All of the buttons are fairly easy to press. The case itself does not add noticeable bulk to your phone, and slides in and out of pockets very easily. There are raised bezels around the top and bottom of the case, while the area in between is left lowered for easy texting. The grip on the back is raised a bit above the back of the case, which I think offers even more protection for your phone, especially when dropped on its back. The case snaps onto your iPhone very easily, which I love.The Bad: This case picks up fingerprints easily, and acquires scratches every once in awhile. The grip on the back of the case is a bit hard, which I do not like. This case is fairly expensive as well.Cool Features: Raised bezels, finger pad grips, reinforced buttons and bumpers, dual layered design.In the Box: In the box, you find the CandyShell Grip case, as well as a warranty.The Verdict: This one of my favorite Speck cases. It offers military grade protection with an attractive, practical design. It doesnt scratch easily, but it does pick up fingerprints very quickly. It is very comfortable to hold as well.

I don't want to drop this new phone, so the grip really helps.It reminds me of a Darth Vader phone case, just looking at it.

Does add some weight and thickness but certainly nothing to worry about.  Definitely snaps on well, nothing loose or shaky at all.  Good solid grip on the sides and back keeps the phone from slipping off a desk or table.Only issue I have so far is that the depth of the case in the opening for the Lightning connector means the case cannot be used with the Apple cable adapter.  The adapter has the old style pin connector on one end and the new Lightning on the other.  But the case depth means you cannot insert the cable into the jack sufficiently to charge the phone.  However, if you are using the normal cable and no adapter, things works just fine.So just keep that in mind if you have the converters for any type of docking station or to use the original cables in any way.Otherwise, no problems at all.",4,Nice Solid Protection at Little Weight,1352073600,"11 5, 2012"

It's the usual hard plastic as most quality cases but these guys, in an effort to assist clumsy phone owners, lined it (on the black case, the gray lines) with a silicone or rubber material that does a great job sticking to your hand, as well as desks and other slippy surfaces.All the openings are all large enough to accept the Apple charger and headphone plug, but will not play well with wider 30-pin to lightning adapters or thicker headphone jacks. The camera opening does not reflect the flash, like other cases we've owned, so all your pictures are clear.The case slipped onto the phone with careful pressing, and it doesn't wobble or move once on. It's thin enough to carry in your pocket, but still covers the phone all around. There's enough of a lip around the screen to keep it from coming into direct contact with surfaces.

While the edges might be protected, this is not going to protect the screen much. I would have liked a better edge bevel to get more protection. I think using the word Shield in the name is misleading, and makes you think it will be a very protective case.  The polycarbonate feels very thin, but it does feel stronger than I thought it would. While I wouldn't expect it to survive getting run over by a car, it is relatively strong and should survive a fall. How much it will protect an iPhone is a different story. I guess it depends on how it falls. If it falls on the case, luck is on your side....if it falls on its face, your luck has run out.

I actually prefer a holster type to carry although, after my HTC Evo,a kick-stand was mandatory for viewing videos.The ONLY downside is that without the Blue Tooth it can be a little cumbersome to talk directly on the phone for long periods and, that it doesn't allow it to stay on my Windshield suction cup holder.However, for this price I HIGHLY recommend this phone case.",5,Fits Perfect.

A1JOSCYS1OIHTJ,B0096T2CMK,reiththestud,"[2, 2]","This case is really great because it clips on and off very easily, but still holds securely. I need to take the case off whenever I put it into my car mount, so this is a really big deal. Quality is nice and it feels very durable. Also, I like how it clips around the corners, because that's the part that's likely to hit the ground in case of a drop. I bought 2 folio-type cases and this is the only one I use.The only downside is there is no cutout where the home button is, so often times when pressure is applied to the front of the case, it will hit the home button and turn the screen on, causing my battery to drain for no reason. If it had a cutout for the home button, it would get 5 stars easily.UPDATE JULY 2013:The reason I consistently used this case over my other folio case was because it was easy to put on and remove. Since I had to remove the case every time I got in my car in order to dock my phone, this was important. I left the case sitting on the dash of my car one day, and the case..... melted. The entire structure became malleable like play-doh. Ironically, it is only this consistency when in the heat of the sun. I tried using a pair of pliers back at home to bend things back into place, but that material has zero give unless it has been heated. As of now, this case is deformed and useless. If you live in a hot climate, don't use this case.UPDATE JANUARY 2014:So after trying some different cases, I purchased a second one of this, this time in white. The white is STUNNING and this case is still the best case I have ever used. I just wish they made one for my new Z Ultra, but they don't :(. I know my last one melted, but I am okay with that.

A23QII83UGZP5U,B0096T2CMK,"Wayne ""Omegafiler""","[6, 7]","I really needed a case for my Sprint GN2 and have always been a fan of this style of convertible cases. I've used them with tablets in the past and they worked rather well. First, the materials appear to be rather nice. Just holding the case it feels well built, descent grip, not slippery, and even has an almost leather-like odor to it. Not bad at all.And because the back/front and 4 corners are covered, you even have a descent amount of protection. This leaves all of the buttons and ports easily accessible. The case is nice and sturdy, and as a result, does add some noticeably bulk, easily doubling the thickness. But you can see that from the pictures. No surprises there. It has all of the expected openings for phone, mic, and even the stylus. Although it is a tad trickier to get to the stylus since the cut-out isn't as big as would like. Could be an issues for larger fingers.However, out of the box, the phone didn't quite fit all that well in the case. I had to bend the 4 grips just so that it would stop popping out so much. Now it's much better, but not as ""tight"" as I would like it to be. It's not going to fall out or anything. And at least the phone is very easy to take in and out of the case. The cover and leather covered clasp both fit and work very well. With a little practice, you can even open it with one hand.The ""convertible"" portion works as expected. Just flip it up and set it in landscape mode and away you go. It has an indention to help keep it propped up in one angle. Although because this phone is so light, I've found you can pretty much put it in any angle you want. And with the new design they have, you no longer have to partially remove it from it's holder to do this.The big issue I have is that there is no indention in the cover for the front Home button. So anytime there is pressure applied to the front of the case, the button is pressed and the phone is turned on. So if it's in a pocket, bag, or if you just happen to squeeze a at the wrong spot, you could have some issues. That's a pretty big oversight in my mind.Also as mentioned above, the new convertible design that allows you to easily switch to landscape mode, also means there is much less support for the cover when it's open. Meaning it'll move around a lot more when not securely closed. Not a big deal, but worth noting.PROS:+ New more efficient convertible case design+ Good quality materials+ Moderate phone protection+ Nice feel & ergonomics+ Easy case removal+ Cheap!CONS:- Poor fitment out of the box- No home button indention- Loose cover when open- Small cut-out for stylusOverall, when you take into consideration it's form, functionality, and especially price, it's really not bad. But the lack of home button indention and less than ideal fit are big negatives for me and will unfortunately prevent me from using it as much as I'd like. Otherwise, for such a cheap case, I'll keep it around and use it occasionally when not traveling.",3,"Not bad, but could be a lot better",1352246400,"11 7, 2012"

A2GOVZPZXLG89C,B009B3H7V2,"B. Cigar ""ladycigar""","[14, 16]","After trying several brands on my iPhone 5, the Acase antiglare/antifingerprint has topped all others. Fingerprints on my display drive me crazy, but I love the beauty of the retina display. I was determined to find the best screen protector that would resist fingerprints and maintain the iPhone 5 display's clarity. Every brand I tried provided either one or the other. Even the brands that advertised as clear and fingerprint resistant proved to fall short and most ""matte"" styles were just too degrading.The Acase brand had only a few reviews, but I decided to give it a try and I am very glad I did. The protector installed without bubbles. I used tape to remove any lint found under the screen during installation and all bubbles were easily removed. I had to take my time and play with it a bit to get it lined up just right, but the install was not difficult. It fits great around the front facing camera, speaker, and homescreen button.When I turned my phone back on, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Acase protector has very minimal degradation to the retina display. The least of all of the antifingerprint screen protectors I have tried (and I have tried quite a few). There is only a slight ""fuzziness"" noted on white or light backgrounds. It is so slight that it is really easy to get use to. Other matte styles were so pixelated that the screen was just too blurry to tolerate.No fingerprints, no glare, and a light matte finish make the Acase screen protector the best for your iPhone 5. To top it off, they are also inexpensive so give the Acase brand a try.",5,The Best!,1350086400,"10 13, 2012"

A343R7D3U18845,B009EARWX0,"Walter Roshon ""Eco tech""","[0, 0]","This was the best value for a Note II protector I could find on Amazon. I haven't experienced any downsides specific to this product other than the wider than average gap to the edge of the screen.This is just one of many ""layers"" of protection for the device. My prime reason for using this type of screen protector is that it provides tensile strength for the glass screen (like laminated auto glass). This reduces the chances of the screen cracking or shattering if the phone is dropped or something is dropped on it. Scratch protection isn't the issue it once was with today's high tech glass screens, but it never hurts.Ease of application, benefit of the 3 packApplying these beasties without bubbles is always a challenge if you don't have a clean room available. With pets in the house, that's not happening. There always seems to be a stray bit of dust that hides until actually applying the protector or picked up from the air after removing the protective layer. The first sheet often ends up being the tack sheet that gets the stray dust for a clean application of the second, so a multipack is a must. I can't remember replacing a protector, even after many years of use, but I still have a pristine sheet for later if needed.Wider than typical gap around the edge of screen (a minus for me, may be a plus for you)All screen protectors need to be a bit smaller than the screen or you have to get the alignment perfect to avoid bits extending over the edge of the screen, which makes for peeling protector syndrome. This protector, and the others I found for the the Note 2, have a larger than typical (it is about 1mm smaller all around). Since this leaves critical corners and edges have less protection, I take 1 star off for that. The screen should still be less susceptible to damage if dropped on a corner than a bare screen.Alignment during application isn't as critical as it would be with a smaller gap and less likelihood of interference with some protective covers that cover the edges of the screen could be considered positives.",4,Good screen protection for a fair price,1359849600,"02 03, 2013"

It's $10 for a case, stylus, and screen protector so I wasn't expecting something with otterbox quality.  Overall, I am pleased with it.  I have had this case since the first week of July and it's still holding on.  The colors are vibrant and it was easy to put on.  It doesn't make the phone seem too big.  Still fits in my wallet.The rubber smells funny at first and took a few weeks to air out.  Also there were some imperfections on the rubber.  Bubbles that you could see and pick off, but whatever.  For $10, I'm not complaining too much.  I've dropped it several times and a few of the clips on the side that hold the plastic case together have fallen off so the case is barely holding on, BUT the main point is my phone didn't get scratched, cracked, or broken in any of the falls.  I'd much rather my cheapo case break than my phone.With all that being said, I would 100% order another one.  Just know, this isn't an extremely high quality case.  It's pretty, it works, but it will break eventually.UPDATE - Beginning of November and all the clips on the side have broken off.  It has been dropped several times and my phone is still OK, but the case is no longer useable.

A3CTFKTUWVDIR2,B009P16FKY,Bryan,"[23, 23]","In case you don't know, here's how this works.  GSM phones (like AT&T;, T-Mobile, and most overseas carriers) use a &#34;SIM&#34; card.  For a while, SIM cards came in one size, and that fit any phone.  However, as phones started to get more and more sophisticated and manufacturers scrambled to fit more inside the device, the SIM card was targeted for size reduction.  First came the Micro-SIM, which is still popular and in use today in many devices (such as the Samsung Galaxy S4).  Then came the Nano-SIM, which is even smaller, and is used in the GSM version of the Apple iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S.But here's the trick... aside from the size of the SIM, all three SIM cards are exactly the same.  In other words, you can take a big SIM and cut it down into a micro or nano SIM size.  The chip in the middle of the card doesn't get damaged and doesn't know or care how much plastic is around it.I purchased this because I wanted to cut my AT&T; Micro-SIM card down to Nano-SIM size for an iPhone 5, but still have the option to use the Nano-SIM in the Galaxy S4 by using an adapter.Cutter:  The cutter that comes in this kit is a very good, solid quality.  It is hard metal and is built like an old fashioned metal stapler.  You put your full size SIM (or Micro SIM in an adapter) in it, press hard, and out comes a nano.  My only criticism of this product is that, since it is a PRESS, the nano SIM that comes out can be a little bit rough-around-the-edges (literally).  I used this on a T-Mobile SIM and I had to sand the edges to get rid of some burrs.  Also, a SIM card should have one corner cut diagonally so that you know which way to put it.  After using this, it was a little unclear which corner was the angled corner because the corners came out a bit rough.  It wasn't a huge problem, but it is something to be aware of.  Another limitation of this press is that it doesn't allow you to create micro SIMs from full size SIMs.  The output is only nano SIMs.I was very pleased with the size-up adapters.  My newly minted nano-SIM snapped into the adapter and worked perfectly in a phone requiring a micro-SIM (Galaxy S4).  I liked these adapters over another version I purchased which did not secure the SIM in place and added to the thickness of the card.  This kit comes with two size-up adapters:  nano to Micro and nano to full.  No micro to full was included.Overall, I was very pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone needing to re-size a SIM down to or up from Nano size.  The price is great, and the drawbacks for the little hand press are easy to overlook in light of quality of the product and its usefulness.",4,The Right Tool for the Job,1382313600,"10 21, 2013"

Although it does cut crooked I was able to cut the edges and such so that it fits just fine in my S3 & S4.As long as you put your MicroSIM Card into the cutter as straight as you can you can cut the sim card just fine to fit in the sim card holder that you make (tell you why I would make one in just a second) just fine and you are able to switch back and forth easily.Before this cutter I had to keep making excuses with my carrier to get free sim cards and I would get them free but I am sure the staff at the stores did not want to see me so much. I had one person ask me if I wanted to keep my iPhone. I love the iPhone but sometimes I just love the customization that android has. Leaving the iOS vs Android debate aside I think that both phones are great phones.The reason why I would suggest that you make your own Nano to MicroSIM Card adaptor is because the one that they provide does not hold the SIM card all that well and if you try to take it out of your phone using that adaptor it will get stuck and you will have to use a knife to get it out...It is just a big pain.

AVYL562Y248JJ,B009P16FKY,G. Ambrose,"[0, 0]","I was traveling to India, and was planning to use my iPhone 5S.  Even though it is a Verizon phone, it has a SIM slot for use with a GSM network, which is the more common system in the rest of the world.  I called up Verizon, and they confirmed that my phone was &#34;unlocked&#34;.  Unfortunately, this phone uses &#34;nano&#34; SIM cards.  The original &#34;standard&#34; size SIM card is about the size of an SD memory card (like the type used in most digital cameras now).  The iPhone 4S switched to a &#34;micro&#34; SIM, and the newest iPhones, use a &#34;nano&#34; SIM which is even smaller.  It is very difficult to get a &#34;nano&#34; SIM card in most places.  Fortunately, the &#34;guts&#34; of a SIM card are located in a very small area in the center of the SIM card, which corresponds to the area occupied by a &#34;nano&#34; SIM card.  The remainder of the surrounding area of a standard or even micro SIM card are just plastic, and don't contain any circuitry.  So, with an appropriate &#34;cutter&#34;, a standard SIM card can be converted to a nano SIM card without damaging the actual functional part of the card.This cutter does just that.  It holds a standard SIM card in a slot, and like a hole punch, cuts out the central portion of the SIM card, with an appropriate notch at one corner, and converts it to a nano SIM card.  It is to be noted that a nano SIM card is also a bit thinner than a standard SIM card, and so they give you a small square of sand paper, with which to sand down the non-contact side of the card.  Sometimes it will fit without sanding, but on my iPhone, I did have to sand it a bit.  They also give you a few adapters, if later, you need to put it in a phone that takes a micro or standard SIM card.  The &#34;nano&#34; card is placed in a little plastic tray like adapter, which matches the size of a standard SIM (or micro SIM), and you just slide it in.  Since the &#34;guts&#34; of the SIM card are only in the central portion, it should work without a problem.The new &#34;nano&#34; card fit perfectly, and my phone worked flawlessly!I personally don't think I would be using this very often since I don't travel frequently.  For someone who travels to many different countries often it would really help.  I would keep it in my handbag and cut the SIM to fit the phone, which ever country you are in.It is a bit heavy, and since it is spring loaded open, you will need to put a rubber band on it to keep it closed.  You may want a small camera case or something to hold the cutter and the adapters that come with it, so that they don't get lost.For anyone who travels abroad and needs to adapt a SIM to fit their phone, this is the way to go.

The new company that I was going with did not have nano cards yet so I needed to be able to cut down a micro sim card.  I ordered this device to accomplish that task.  Here is what I liked:1.  The device is well made and includes all of the parts that the listing says it does.  There is a metal tray to hold the micro SIM so that you can cut it to a nano size.  You can also cut full size SIM cards to nano size.  NOTE:  No where in the product information does it claim to cut standard to micro as some other reviewers have thought.  This device makes NANO SIMS out of standard and micro SIMs.2.  The tool is easy to use, but takes a bit of pressure to make the cut.  If you take the time to line up everything, you can get a nice cut.  They include a bit of sand paper to smooth out any rough edges.3.  The included trays to change your nano back into a micro or regular size SIM work and allow you to move the SIM back and forth between different devices.What I did not like:Actually, there was not anything to complain about with this product.  It does exactly what it says.  It also warns you that some Micro SIMs are thicker than standard and that it could cause issues with your device after being cut if it is too thick for the tray.  I did not find any problems here, but it is probably worth checking before you cut.As normally happens, just after I got this and cut down my SIM, the company I was getting service from came out with a nano SIM.  So, you might double check with your service provider BEFORE buying this as you might not need it.I will carry this with me when I travel as I have found that inexpensive SIMs are usually available at airports but they are generally full size.  This will allow me to cut one down and use it when I need it.I would recommend this device to anyone who has a need for a nano size SIM and can only find a micro or regular size SIM chip.",5,QQ Tech Nano Sim Card Cutter,1384300800,"11 13, 2013"

I only had the one that came with the iPhone 5 so this cutter provided a perfect copy using my other micro sims.  Using the new sims required a little sanding to reduce the thickness of the sim since the nano is slight thinner.  Basically once the AT&T paint was gone it fit perfectly into the iPhone 5.  Also, the included adapters worked in reverse. I could use the nano sim from my iPhone 5 in my Galaxy Note 2 without problem.  Using the cut nano sim with the adapter was a little trickier.  Be careful when removing it from the phone as you could catch one of the pins inside the slot.  I felt it catch a little so I inserted it again and tried removing a second time.  It worked.

Took some force to get it to go over the phone as the fit is tight and with half of the back (for kickstand) being stiff plastic and not all TPU it makes it less flexible.Once I got it on the first thing I noticed was that the *lip* that comes over the face is uneven, specifically it does not come up as far on the bottom edge. Not a deal breaker but provides less protection to the bottom end of the phone (where the chance of impact is greatest in my opinion).The kickstand hinge obviously makes the phone a little uneven when laying flat, again, not a deal breaker.The kickstand, when popped out provides adequate support and seems to provide some adjustment for viewing angle, but if pushed to hard (like if you are using the touch screen aggressively) the kickstand will fold back and your device will be (almost) flat on the table.The price is right (=cheap) but then you are getting your money's worth. If I didn't have such a high-end device and was looking for something to accentuate it's features; I would use this. As it stands, I tried it for 10 minutes and then returned to my all TPU case with no kickstand.I want the most protection and better build.I would suggest a case made softer, better fitting, and thick enough on the back to allow the device to lay stable on it's back when the kickstand is retracted.Just my opinion, Hope it helps someone make a educated decision.",2,"Poor fit, kickstand just okay",1356220800,"12 23, 2012"

I wouldn't necessarily trust this case to save my Note 2 from a major drop onto a hard surface like concrete, especially if it landed on the pen corner, but for basic protection from scuffs and bumps, it's great so far. It's rather difficult to find a rugged cover for the Note 2 anyway and it's already a large phone so any extra bulk would not be welcome. And the flip covers ... too much effort for regular use. So, this cover is a good compromise if you want the ""phablet"".PROS1. Thick enough around the edge to give the impression it would actually protect against a reasonable drop2. Buttons work pretty well through the sides although the volume ones are a little more difficult to locate on the fly ... just a little3. Openings in all the right places although would prefer a little more protection on the pen corner. Again, the Note 2 comes with certain tradeoffs and this is one of them.4.

My aunt saw it and said, &#34;I wan't that case for my phone!&#34; She has an iphone 5.The only reason I deducted a star is because of the kickstand. My issue with this is actually two-fold. The first reason is that it is very flimsy and looks/feels like it will break on repeated use. Maybe even light use. Only time will tell. But it's so bad I'm afraid to use it. The second thing is that the plastic hinges for the stand stick out of the case so it is not possible to lay the phone flat on it's back on the table. Therefore an accidental brush against the phone or table shake causes a &#34;slippy-slide&#34; effect and can potentially knock the phone right off the table.That being said, I'm happy with the looks and kickstand functionality (although not the kickstand itself) but hey, for 2 bucks, who can complain?",4,Good case for 2 bucks,1355097600,"12 10, 2012"

This phone did come unlocked and works with a t-mobile sim card. I did purchase this phone new but like most users here I received it used with minor scratches and sadly only came with the charger. I did however manage to get some sort of discount for this condition. Above all this phone is great for any shutterbug. The touch screen is sensitive-- more so than my iPad2!!Now for the cons: not a lot of apps, which is okay! I'm not much of an app user. The only apps I really use on the 920 are facebook, gmail, skydrive and instagraph.that being said the battery life is pretty poor. I was quite shocked after the 100% charge i had it before I slept but then in the morning it dropped to 89%. WOW. What happened? Apparently this is a major problem that Nokia/Microsoft haven't really (at least what I think) brought up. Google tips on how to increase the battery life.Note: this phone is heavier than you might actually expect. But with that aside I'm pretty happy with my purchase. If weight is an issue then wait for the 925.That's why I gave this 4/5 stars.---- Update 7/18/13Now I rate this 2/5 given that the battery life has been dropping more since I tried to increase it. The phone is a phone hog. I've turned off some apps, other items on the phone and put it on the not recommend battery saver mode, but the phone is still sucking up the battery like no other.

A3NK28P0BSBJY4,B009ZC90P0,Megatron63,"[5, 6]","The Nokia Lumia 920 is an excellent phone, but there were a few problems along the way. Let me explain...I purchased a glossy red Nokia 920 on November 9th (Launch Day) at the local ATT store. Personally, I wanted to give the yellow version a try, but the store only had the red, black, white, and gray versions available. So, I paid $450 for the red phone ""off-contract"" and also received the wirelesss charging device (black) at no charge. When I decided to buy the Nokia, I was upgrading from my trusty HTC TITAN (AWESOME phone, btw!) and wanted to experience Microsoft's new mobile operating system. Windows Phone 8 is a fast and stable OS, which offers some enhancements not available on earlier models. Setting up my phone was extremely easy and you are offered very clear instructions on the device. Most of the AT&T; employees I met are not very savvy on Windows Phone devices, so I made sure I was the one setting up the device at the store. Upon entering my Windows Live info, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all my contacts transferred extremely fast (took less than a minute to transfer). Apps and media, however, required more time. By the way, the excellent Zune software used on Windows Phone 7.5 devices is incompatible with this phone. However, if you have Windows 7 on your PC, you can use Windows Explorer to transfer media files. If you have Windows 8 or a Mac, there's an app for transferring media to your phone. Also, there are some WP 7.5 apps which are not compatible with Windows Phone 8. For example, the Xbox LIVE game called ""The Harvest"" is currently incompatible and won't even show up in a Marketplace search when you use the Nokia 920. Update (2/16/13): Some apps are already being ported over to WP8, so it will take some time for this to happen.After about a day of using the Nokia Lumia 920, I noticed the battery discharged to 50% in two hours. I wasn't using it that much during those two hours, but when I was on YouTube, the Lumia's case got extremely hot. This led me to believe that there was a problem with the battery, because my HTC TITAN never had that type of problem. Anyway, I returned it to the ATT store and replaced it with a glossy white version. Now, my new Nokia Lumia 920 works fine and doesn't have any of the battery problems found on the red one I returned. Aside from the battery issue on my first phone, I really like the Lumia 920!Pros:- Nice high resolution screen w/ Gorilla Glass- Solid and beautiful case- Outstanding still camera and video records at 1080p- Camera can be upgraded, using software ""lenses"". These enhancements bring additional features to the device!- Dedicated camera button- Great Nokia apps- Great Marketplace layout- Quality WP apps (Check out ""MetroTube"")- Good sound- 32GB memory- NFC compliant- Xbox LIVE games- Drag and drop media onto phone- Wireless charging is built-in (requires special charger)- Full PC/Mac compatibility- The SkyDrive app allows fantastic integration with your cloud filesCons:- No expandable memory! That is probably my biggest gripe about this phone.- Can't transfer or purchase Zune videos to the phone (at least, I couldn't)- Heavy (but its a solid device)- No custom alert or notification sounds (custom ringtones and alarms only)- Marketplace still missing some major apps found on other platforms- Wish it had a 4.7"" screen or larger, like my HTC TITAN (I do notice the difference in screen size)- No longer uses the Zune softwareOverall, I'm happy with the phone and have no regrets. I would certainly recommend this device to anyone looking for a Windows Phone device or a just a great smartphone.UPDATE - 2/6/13: I was asked if a data plan is required to use this phone. Well, the answer is yes and no. Yes, if you plan on using it on the carrier's cellular network. AT&T;, for example, will receive notification that you are using a smartphone to make calls and will charge you for data usage. On the other hand, if you don't intend to use it as a cellular phone and don't access the 3G/4G networks, you can use it as an Internet device. In other words, you can use Skype to make phone calls over wi-fi, continue to download and use apps, take pictures and video, and surf the Internet over wi-fi. I used to do that with my old HTC Titan (Windows Phone 7.5) without any problems.Bottom-line: Highly recommend this phone for someone who wants a powerful, ""does-all"" device! If you are tied deeply to iOS and/or Android and can't handle change, the transition might not be so great. However, five solid stars for this device!!",5,"The Nokia Lumia 920 is an Excellent Smartphone! Watch out, iPhone 5!",1353628800,"11 23, 2012"

A2NOW4U7W3F7RI,B009ZC90P0,rpv,"[7, 7]","Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5"" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of ""armor,"" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are ""stuffed"" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.",5,Best Windows Phone as of early 2013,1368835200,"05 18, 2013"
A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B009ZC90P0,Talvi,"[12, 13]","I've had two Lumia 900s, both suffered drops that cracked the screen (though they also made it safely through quite a few drops, I am a klutz).  So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it.  It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I'm loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900's vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go.  Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps.  I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history.The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. There are still some problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the battery life is still not great (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it's hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down.  All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has.PROS*Form Factor: it's different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter.  People want it, or want to try it.*Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn.  Sharp.*Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction.  It is also impressively sensitive.  Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves.*Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface.  I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I'm still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries.*Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it's optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It's zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported.*Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I'm cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc).*Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can't set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however.*Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker.*Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone.CONS*Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand.*Battery: Yes, it's a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but a little shorter battery life is the result.*Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline.  The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people's hands while still maintaining quality.*My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone. I loved the N9 for that.  Please bring that functionality to Lumia.",4,Dare to be different,1353369600,"11 20, 2012"

The weird part is the extra steps needed to install it compared to other screen protectors. It comes with a solution that you have to wet it with first in order for it to stick. Having it wet does help with giving you a few chances to get the install right in case you crinkle it or get debris under it, but it's just a weird extra step that maybe isn't all that necessary. The other gripe I have is that the DNA screen is already prone to glare in direct sunlight, and this thing tends to exacerbate that problem. It's fine indoors or in the car, but if you use your phone a lot outside you may want to stay away.For the most part though this is a pretty good screen protector.",3,Mostly good but some odd stuff involved,1358294400,"01 16, 2013"

Whether they peeled off on the edge or left unbearable oils on the screen, they all ended up in the garbage. I decided to try the Skinomi protector because it is a wet application protector and it is clear as apposed to that orange peel look that invisibleshield or others have.I've got to say, this screen protector is awesome! The fit is perfect, the installation is straight forward and easy. All the bubbles and imperfections work their way out in about 2 days. What I really like about this screen protector is the clearness. There is absolutely no orange peel. Also, it feels really nice to the fingers and leave very little finger prints! Be warned, however, the protector is ""soft"" so if you ding your screen with your nails, you'll leave an imprint on the protector. Not a big deal but it's something you be aware of if you really care about how the protector looks. Overall, it's a great buy.

AXUM7P0TGMPL9,B00A7HY9ZS,Joshua-1,"[4, 6]","The screen protector is fantastic but if you've never used one of these rubbery screen protectors they can be hard to get used to. The process for putting them on is a little strange but the end result is they go on without bubbles or dust underneath every time. Right after you put it on you will have this moment of panic because it's not very clear in spots... Relax, in a day it will be flawless, don't get all impatient and try to squeeze the microscopic air out. It somehow magically disappears. The screen protector is very soft/thick. So soft in fact that if you press hard enough you can eave an impression of your fingerprint. This means if you leave it resting against something in your pocket or ding it somehow it will get a little mark in it and that mark will stay there for a while. but not forever, the screen protector eventually levels itself out again, depending on the severity of the mark it can take many days, but it will eventually flatten out.One thing I didn't realize about this screen protector before I bought it is that it will efectively cure minor scratches. I had a long but not very deep scratch on my DNA that was incredibly annoying to me because the phone was otherwise flawless. Once I put this skin on I can no longer see it at all even though I know exactly where it is and I've looked for it.Due to the way he DNA is designed the glass curves down at the edges. Softer screen protectors like these curve with it and cover the entire glass (Harder screen protectors just stop short of the curve). Some cases wrap around and also cover some portion of the glass. These cases tend to push up on the edge of the screen protectors ruining them. If you want a case and don't want to deal with this issue, please get the case I link below. I bought at least 2 other cases before I got this one and it's not only cheaper than the others, it's unquestionably better. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AI92O9S/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_imgThe last thing I want to say is Skinomi is very serious about that lifetime warranty. My first screen protector got ruined by a case like I described above. Once I found the right case, I contacted Skinomi, told them what happened and they sent me an entire new skin kit no questions asked. I had it two days later.

A2EJIPSUG5J6NH,B00A7HY9ZS,Thang Nguyen,"[5, 6]","Having tried many types and brands of screen protectors over the years, I always end up coming back to Skinomi.  Some of the reasons why are because they are high quality (material doesn't have the ""orange peel"" effect seen on competitor products), easy to install, and cost much lower than the competition you see in certain B&M; stores.After washing my hands as stated in the directions (clearly on the box), the process of installing only takes anywhere between 2-5 minutes depending if you get it right the first time.  This time on my Droid DNA, it took me a little longer due to the fact that the edges of the glass was curved.  Not only that but when using the squeegee, the screen protector slid off center.  This was an easy fix as all I had to do was slide it back into place and re-squeegee.The longest part of the install would be the waiting for it to dry. For those new to this type of screen protector, keep in mind it will look bad once it's first installed because there is still liquid between the screen protector and the glass.  Skinomi says there will be a wait time if 12-24 hours till it clears but I believe they state that to be safe.  I've seen my screen clear up in as little as 2-4 hours and completely clear up in around 8.  All in all, I've have had Skinomi on my last 3 phones (Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus, Razr) and wouldn't hesitate to have Skinomi on my next 3 phones.One final note.  You may see a few people complaining about the screen protectors not working with cases.  That happens to be the case (no pun intended) with many of these screen protectors.  You must find a case that accommodates screen protectors otherwise you will end up with a case that covers too much of the edge of the screen which pushes or lifts up the screen protector.

The case covers the sensor which means while you are on a call, the phone will not lock (aka the screen will not turn black) and your cheek, ear, etc will hit buttons while you are on the call continuously. I've had this case for 2 days and it disrupted every single one of my calls I have had. Sadly, do not buy this case.

I suppose that may be an issue if you intended to keep thephone in a really dirty environment or text while eating hot wings or something.---Some felt the kick stand was a weak point, the kick stand is sturdy enough to hold the weight of the phone at a tilt w/o problem.Though I imagine if you tried to break it you could, it is just plastic after all.---One I can kind of see where people are coming from is the case is made of hard plastic that just has no give to it. This can cause thecase to be slightly harder to hold on to then a rubberalternative material. One thing to counter this is that the design of the entire case is essentially textured so the case is by no means slick and difficult to handle.---------------------------Final ThoughtsIf you need a case, stop thinking about it and just buy this already.

A3EPHBMU07LZ50,B00B544U24,Mysterious Reviewer,"[2, 2]","The SimplyVibe V5-BT1 is a small stereo speaker measuring about 1.5 by 2.5 by 6 inches. It may be powered by an internal lithium ion battery which can be charged by any USB power source. We connected it to blue tooth on several devices inncluding an iPhone, iPod, MacBook and an HP laptop. Bluetooth connectivity was simple on all the bluetooth sources though the laptops required a little more standard set-up work with the HP (and I assume all Windows computers) having to find, install and configure the drivers for the device.As expected from a small, low power speaker the volume capability is quite limited but is fine for personal, nearfield listining.A quick check on my spectrum analysis program shows, a surprisingly flat spectrum for such a tiny speaker. While there is a sharp roll-off in low end response below 150hz, with little output below about 100 hz, that is as expected and is a very respectable performance for a speaker of this size. Above 150 hz, response is flat within about plus or minus 3 db to over 15 khz.The result is a clean, pleasant, relatively detailed sound that I found quite listenable for moderate volume music playback . It is a huge step up from the internal speakers in phones, tablets or even most laptop computers, and it would make a good choice for a travel sound system for music or movies. Additionally, the speakerphone capability is a handy plus.Highly recommend.Penmouse",5,Surprising sound in a small box,1378512000,"09 07, 2013"

A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00BB0VD4K,Comdet,"[0, 0]","I was very impressed with the construction quality of this case. The leather is very smooth and supple. It has the feel of a high quality wallet. The stitching is even and tight. I could live without the embossed ""V"" logo at the base, but it's not too obtrusive.The case fits the 5s very well, with no wriggling or rattle.One of the benefits of the case is that it allows you to carry cash or credit cards in the pouch. Well in theory you could, but anything more than a single card makes the case bulge out and kills the sleek look. Plus, it's a tight fit to get anything in and out of the pouch.You can also open the case and keep things in the midsection since it has a magnetic closure. Again, that's somewhat impractical - there is only one magnet at the upper corner, leaving the bottom corner unlatched. Slim, lightweight items (such as paper currency) stay put, but credit cards fell out when I gave it a shake test.Still, it's well worth considering if you're looking for a nicely made, attractive leather case. Just don't expect it to serve as a pack mule - it can take a card or two, or perhaps a bill or two, but that's about it.[Sample provided for review]",4,Sleek look; excellent quality construction; some constraints on what it can hold,1381795200,"10 15, 2013"

A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00BB0VD4K,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[1, 1]","The Vault Skin case is essentially a plastic snap-on case with a leather flap and magnet attached to the back so that you can carry credit cards and cash in the same package as your iPhone 5.  Although I usually carry my phone in my handbag and don't need this kind of design, I find it almost-perfect for situations -- barbecues, sporting events, day hiking -- where I don't want anything more than what I can stick comfortably in my pockets.  I like that I have have my driver's license, a few credit cards, money, and my phone all at the ready to be pulled from my back pocket with a single tug.It took me a while to find the best configuration for credit cards and money since folded bills stashed with the credit cards caused the cards to spill out occasionally when I extracted the phone wallet from my pocket.  I learned to put the cards in the magnetized pocket and the bills in the small flap at the back.  Or, since the flap can only hold one card, I can put my driver's license there and the money in the magnetized section when I don't need credit cards.  (American bills must be folded in thirds or quarters to fit within the width of the wallet.)  The credit cards stay within the magnetized wallet as long as I don't knock it or hold it upside down for a while.  For this reason, I don't have complete faith that I won't lose anything from it.  The manufacturer could improve this by extending the elastic at the base to slightly around the corner.  Even a small area would help keep the cards in place.  Anything wider than a standard credit card will stick out and therefore be prone to falling out.I haven't owned this long enough to notice any quality issues, and so far, everything has held up to in-and-out-of-pocket use.  The stitching in the leather seems even and fine.  The matte black plastic snap-on case is rigid enough to keep the iPhone secure without making it impossible to insert.  The camera cut-out does not interfere with taking photos.  The bottom and top are completely cut out, as is the area around the mute and volume buttons.In terms of protection, this is a minimalist case, as most snap-on cases are.  Unlike some, however, the Vault's has a lip that curves a little to protect the edges of the screen.  Although it's not great protection, it does offer a bit more than many snap-ons.  The best part of the case is the combination of a slim profile with an added function --- the ability to carry a few essentials in the same space/package as the iPhone 5.  When I want to keep everything in the back pocket of my jeans, I snap my phone into the Vault.

A36K2N527TXXJN,B00BB0VD4K,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"[9, 10]","Over the years my wallet has become bulkier and bulkier, and the number of accessories that I constantly have to remember to carry with me has increased beyond what anyone should find reasonable to carry around. So I was really excited to come across an iPhone case that doubles as a wallet. It held the promise of substantially reducing the bulk in my pockets, and so far it has lived up to its expectations.I was at first very skeptical of this wallet's light and fairly open design to be able to hold some of my most precious cards and documents securely. So at first I decided to test it with a few store cards and expired gym membership cards just to see how it fares. After just a few days of this I decided to switch to the ""real"" documents and credit cards, and so far I have not regretted it. The magnetic clasp is very secure, and the front pocket is also extremely tight and safe. I would still prefer that there were some kind of ""inner"" compartment or a fold, so that no side of my cards is directly exposed to the outside. However, this might increase its bulk and diminish the number of cards I am able to carry without substantially improving on security.The wallet is also capable in principle of holding paper bills, but I have not been able to put more than one or two at the time without substantially compromising the overall bulk.Besides the functionality, one thing that sticks out about this case is its design. It is very elegant, with the genuine leather wallet. I do think that the plastic case attachment to the iPhone could have been a bit sturdier and more secure, but on the other hand this too would have added to the bulk.One issue with this case/wallet that I have is the same one that affects most of my other iPhone cases: using external docks and other accessories becomes almost impossible. This was a bit too much of a setback for me with the regular cases, but a case that doubles as a wallet is definitely worth the tradeoff.I guess the ultimate endorsement for this product that I can have is to point out that this is one of the few products and accessories that I use on a daily basis and carry with me everywhere. It has greatly helped me decrease the clutter in my pockets. Now if someone could just come up with an app that replaces all of my keys ...",5,High Quality iPhone Case/Wallet,1378080000,"09 02, 2013"
A3V5F050GVZ56Q,B00BB0VD4K,Dre,"[20, 22]","I was provided a Vaultskin Slim Leather Wallet Case for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; The case is pretty thin.  Doesn't add too much bulk when empty.&#9830; It is a plastic case with a leather flap and pouch on the back and a strong magnet enclosure.&#9830; Nice option if you have a few cards and don't want to carry a wallet.&#9830; All buttons and ports are easily accessible.&#9830; Almost no screen protection with only a slightly raised bezel around the screen.&#9830; No internal cushion so minimal impact protection and the top and bottom of the phone are not covered at all.&#9830; Holds the advertised 8 cards, but gets significantly more bulky which is to be expected.Detailed Review:&#9830; Background - I have a Black iPhone 5 that I keep in an Incipio Dual PRO Case. The Incipio is a great blend of protection and size. It has a silicone internal shell for cushion covered by a hard outer shell. It adds some bulk, but not a crazy amount like an Otterbox. When reviewing a case, I always think of my Incipio case for my comparisons.&#9830; Look and Installation - The product came in a professional looking hanging box with some basic product information on it.  Inside the box was the iPhone case encased in plastic to protect it.  There was nothing else in the box.  The case consists of a plastic case that covers the sides of the phone, but does not cover the top or bottom.  It has a slightly raised bezel from the sides where it wraps around the phone, but we're talking less than a millimeter, so you really don't get any kind of significant screen protection or impact protection.  The back of the case has a hole for the camera and a pocket and leather flap with a strong magnet to hold money and cards.  It was very easy to install my iPhone 5 into the case.  It snapped in with no problem.  Once the case is on, it looks pretty good and seems to have a solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, it worked as intended. All of the ports were easily accessible due to a cutout for the volume buttons and no cover on the top or bottom.  I then tried to putting money and cards into the wallet part of the case on the back of the phone.  The phone isn't wide enough to just fold cash in half, so you would have to fold a bill more than once to get it to fit without sticking out.  As for cards, you can fit one card in the pocket, but it is very tight and isn't easy to take out and put back in.  You can also fit several more cards in the larger flap with the magnet, but it obviously gets bulkier with additional cards.  I was able to add an additional 7 cards for a total of 8 as advertised, but it was bulky.  While you get some scratch protection to the sides of the phone, you get very minimal impact protect and almost no screen protection.  This case is mainly built for the wallet.  Since it doesn't have any kind of cushion with it being direct case to phone contact, you shouldn't expect much in the way of major drop or impact protection. Also with the case only covering the sides and not extending past the screen much, you really don't have any screen protection either. This is all fine as long as that is what you are looking for.  With money and cards in the case, it was pretty easy to slip it into my pocket and take it out.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice wallet case that provides some scratch protection to the body. It can hold cash and several cards that makes it a good replacement for a small wallet.  It is not intended to provide major drop or impact protection and it is not intended to provide screen protection. If you are looking for major damage protection covering the entire phone, you should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a wallet case that holds a fair amount of cards and money without adding too much bulk, this case is worth a look.",4,What You Should Know Before You Buy!,1383350400,"11 2, 2013"

We've been giving it a workout and here's what we've found.The case is  attractive and quite slim, super when you can take only a limited number of items with you.  However, it does not fit an iPhone 5C correctly.  Because there are no overlapping bits on the short ends to keep the phone in place, we were  quite concerned that the phone could easily slip right out of the case.My other huge concern was the ""street smarts"" of this particular phone case.  iPhones and other smart phones are a frequent target for theft.  It seems to me that advertising that you are carrying cash and card by placing them in an position for all to see when you use the phone is perhaps asking for trouble.

As one example, many sports and concert venues no longer allow women to carry purses into the place. (In our case, it's the Georgia Dome.) The leather wallet case was designed for those times. It's well made from real leather and what appears to be polystyrene plastic. My wife's iPhone 4 snapped crisply into the case, and it's not going to fall out. All of the iPhone's controls, the camera and flash, and the audio port are open. The leather wallet portion has a small magnet that keeps it securely closed until you pop it open. The outside pocket is for a credit card. My only qualm about the wallet case is that a credit card fits so tightly in the pocket that it's a bit difficult getting it in and out. You could put it in the inside flap, but that was meant for some currency, and it might be too close to the magnet then.As a protective case for the iPhone, I give the wallet case very high marks. For cash, it will hold a few bills, although they need to be folded twice to fit inside.

The way the pockets are laid out, all of the bulk falls right in the center, so it doesn't close quite right. Not going to bother to return it. I might give it another shot in a few months.

A3C46B2H1XC2HM,B00BBD0A82,Skinny Jay,"[0, 0]",I loved this wallet until it fell apart.The only flaw with this wallet is that the phone bracket is a hard plastic that eventually cracked and broke apart.I carry a spare battery or two with me and change them out almost everyday.  As an android user this is one of my favorite options for these types of phones.  That meas that I open and close my phone's back cover often.  Taking the phone in and out of the hard plastic bracket every day for 6 months took a toll on it and it finally broke enough to stop holding the phone.I absolutely loved the card pockets and the the magnetic closure.  The smart cover feature worked perfectly as expected and the material looked and felt nice.If they replaced the bracket with a flexible rubber type then I would buy another one.  Instead I bought one that makes it easy to take the phone in and out and has a full surrounded rubber case that protects the phone better anyway.

They look almost identical (with the exception of deeper contact grooves on the 7500 mAh battery. I completed the break-in period of charging the battery overnight for at least 5 cycles. This battery performs almost like the 5200 mAh batteries. This is probably either a 5200 mAh or a 5800 mAh battery in disguise, just relabeled.-PROS-I will not even entertain this. I have no reason to praise a MicroPack technology battery that may have a larger capacity than the stock battery but does not actually operate at its listed capacity. There is no need to know how long this battery will last you. Just buy the 5200 mAh variant and save yourself the extra few dollars. I recommend that battery, I do not recommend this one. I promise you, you won't even notice a performance difference if you bought both, like I did.-CONS-The MicroPack version of this battery does not operate at its listed capacity. You will get the performance of a 5200 mAh battery out of this. Just because of this fact, I cannot give this product more than a star. Not only is the capacity unreliable, but it also has issues with NFC. It cannot reliably read NFC tags and you would have to brush the phone on the tag several times for a chance to have the tag read by the phone. You also could not use S-Beam reliably with this battery but you can still use Tap and Pay with Google Wallet. Still not worth a buy.

I kept noticing that my 3g and 4g kept going in and out and at times I would lose data signal all together while there phones where able to keep signal.

I really appreciate them being honest. The wanted to send me out a replacement battery right away. I declined and told them that I would send it back to amazon. Basically the design of the battery is blocking the radio receiver for the phone or at least interrupting the signal. I did order the 3 of the Hyperion  5200Ah batteries for myself wife and daughter.

Even before installing the screen protectors, I knew it was good quality just from the feel in the hand. The big difference between this protector and others is that this one protects the front as well as the back. These protectors are more of a film layer and less of a plastic sheet. This film protects the screen versus just covering it.Like all protectors they can be tricky to install, so be sure to read the enclosed instructions or watch one of the install videos on their website. After reading the instructions and viewing an install video they go on like a piece of cake. The first step is to clean the screen and back the with the enclosed lint free cloth. Next, spray the protectors with the supplied application solution, and then start applying it to the screen. I find it best to position the screen around the camera and sensor first. As for the back protector, position it around the speaker.To ensure the best results, be sure to start with clean washed hands. There will be some excess water on the screen and back, to push it to the outer edge, remove this with a paper towel. There will be some small air bubbles, they will disappear within a day or two. Leave the device to dry for 24 hours (overnight) before powering on the device.Once all of these steps you have completed, you will have a phone will premium full body protector.CONTENTS:Skinomi ProtectorsLint-Free Polishing ClothInstruction ManualI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.",5,Invisibly Protects Your Entire Phone,1395792000,"03 26, 2014"

It was a little hard to lay out the first time and I had to re-stick it so there is a little section of fuzz. I like the full cover skin effect though.

I was very pleased to see that the &#34;orange peel&#34; appearance has almost been eliminated.  The skin molds around rounded edges and covers to the edge.

Very hassle free and pleasant people to deal with. I had a Skinomi Screen protector on my S2 before and it worked great and anyone who has used these protectors before can attest to their quality. First if all it is a wet installation, so be prepared to get your phone a little wet, but not to worry, it's a safe process. The screen protector itself is great at covering the screen while allowing the right cut outs for the respective ports and sensors. It does not hamper the touch sensitivity at all either. The protector is soft yet strong. Also the back pieces fits well and prevents scratches to the back cover. The side pieces are very tricky and do stick well at first, but I usually put my phone in a pouch and sometimes the sides get hooked and may eventually pull apart. But that might just have been my careless installation and handling of the product and phone. It does say to allow the protectors to set for at least 24 hrs and this is what you should definitely do. It may give some color distortion (a colored glare at some angles) as the protector gets worn, but honestly it is nothing you can't live with.  Again a great product and great service all round. I would definitely use this product again as well as this company. Keep up the good work.",5,Great Product and Great Customer Service,1381622400,"10 13, 2013"

These are excellent if you want to keep the look and feel of your device and still have scratch protection.This is a wet install item, meaning that skinomi sends a spray bottle with solution to assist in installing the protector.  Follow the directions provided and you should have little to no trouble with it.A couple tips for installation...1. use your bathroom for installation.  run your shower on hot for a bit, get some steam in the air before you start.  Helps reduce dust particles floating around and getting on your device or the protector.2. use as much spray solution as you need, just be sure to wipe it up before too long.3. for those that get the full body skin protection, the piece for the back plate or any piece that needs to bend around at all, get the piece aligned and use a blow dryer to get the folds to stick.  This will take a little time, but is totally worth it.My only issue with this specific model (the full skin protector for the Galaxy S4) is that the pieces for the sides, top and bottom of the phone stretch extremely easily and may not fit if they get stretched.  There are overlaps at the top and bottom of the power button and overlap at the bottom of the volume rocker.You may also consider not using your phone much immediately after installation.

A3VSLO08YVR853,B00C3A6KKO,Nick,"[51, 56]","First off, since a picture is worth a thousand words, see my 4 customer images (uploaded by 'Nick'). For such a small package, (about 8""x8"" square and 1"" thick including the handy pocket), this thing really works well. It will even charge your devices indoors under the right kind of lighting (halogen or incandescent work surprisingly well, while fluorescent does not really work much at all). I didn't upload any pictures showing its power output from indoor lighting as most people will not use it this way. However, if you're going to have a light on anyway, why not put it to good use charging one of the many electronic gadgets we all seem to have these days?Power output:In the pictures I uploaded, you can see a tree and two cropped images of my multimeterEquus 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeterscreen. (This is a great all-around meter too!) To connect the two metal meter probes to a solar panel with only a USB output was done by cutting the proprietary connector off of an old USB cable for a device I no longer owned, stripping the wires inside (black and red only--that cord had no data wires), connecting those black and red wires in the USB cable to alligator clips and then to the probes on the multimeter. Then I simply plugged in the male end of that sacrificial USB cable to the panel. Is there the potential for power loss doing it this way (thus skewing my results to the conservative side)? Yes. Is it cheaper than a dedicated USB power meter. Yes. Alright, for the nitty-gritty details:Indoors, you can probably expect about 4.5-5.5V and 0.25A (obviously depending upon lighting conditions)Outdoors:Cloudy conditions with a thunderstorm rolling in: 5.87V and 0.39A, giving you 2.29 wattsMostly cloudy conditions: 5.67V and 0.512A, giving you 2.903 wattsMostly sunny conditions: 5.76V and 0.694A (a separate reading yielded 0.72A), giving you 3.997 wattsFull sun conditions: 5.66V and 1.047A (wow!), giving you 5.92 watts**There is a label directly on the panel I received that says it's rated for 3.5 watts, so maybe the manufacturer takes some sort of average of many types of conditions? I think the Amazon detail page for this panel says something like 6 watts, and in fact there is another identical panel sold by another Amazon seller that they rate for 6 watts, but it's almost triple the price when you factor in the discount you get for purchasing the battery power pack along with this panel from EasyAcc.Build quality:Pretty impressive; seems to made of ballistic nylon with snaps that click with authority and metal-reinforced holes at each corner to attach it to nearly anything your imagination can come up with. There is a female USB cord that pulls out of the pocket, and plenty of room to hide a cell phone while it's charging or a portable battery pack. Note: I purchased this panel with the EasyAcc 12000mAh battery packEasyAcc 12000mAh 4 USB External Battery Pack Charger Power Bank For iPhone 5 4S 4 3GS; iPad Mini, iPad 4 3 2; Android Tablets:Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, Note 8.0 10.1; Google Nexus 7,10; Microsoft Surface Pro ; Acer B1; iPod; Android Smartphone: Samsung Gala...], which is also an excellent product, although it's too long to fit in the pocket on this solar panel. EasyAcc had (and still appears to have as of this writing) a deal where you could get something like 40% off of this panel if you purchase one of their other qualifying products, hence the battery pack. The panel is already a great deal on its own, but the discount makes it almost a steal.A note on using this panel by itself or with a battery pack: It's recommended that you connect this panel to a battery pack and then connect the battery pack to your device (phone, tablet, etc.). The reason for this is simply because the intensity of the sunlight hitting this panel will naturally vary with cloud cover, the position of the sun in the sky, etc. As such, whatever you're charging with this panel will receive a variable level of current and voltage. On many devices, this is not an issue (because of internal charge controller circuitry), but many have said that if the level of current flowing to an Apple i-device dips below a certain threshold, the device will stop charging and display an error message about the charging cable not being compatible, or something of that ilk. Sometimes that message will go away on its own and start charging again. However, you may end up having to go over to your i-device, unplug the charging cable from it and then reconnect it. Having to babysit your device while it charges hardly seems worth the effort. By using the panel to charge a battery pack and then using said battery pack to charge your device, you're ensuring that the amount of current and voltage being output to the device is as consistent as possible. Even though it's not really close to the same thing (DC vs. AC for one thing), that's the same reason home solar and wind power systems feed a battery bank which then powers your household devices via an inverter. Of course if you're in a pinch and have a dead phone and this panel but no additional battery pack, this panel is gonna save the day. Excellent for camping, hiking and anywhere else you don't have access to conventional power sources but still have USB-powered devices to charge. For the money, this is definitely one of the most effective solar panels (power per dollar) you can buy. 10 stars!",5,Lots of power in a small package for only a little money!,1371945600,"06 23, 2013"

I like that it's smooth and stiff, thus making it easy to pull out of my pocket.  And I like the look of the black case, even with the faint glitter.However, the case simply does not fit perfectly on the phone.  It raised my eyebrows when I took the case out of the package and noticed it had a flat back.  Those who own this phone knows that it has a curved back.  Well, when I put the case on, it does hug the back and sides nicely, but it does not sit straight along the top and bottom like it shows in the pictures.  It bows enough along the top and bottom that it barely covers the edges of the phone in the middle.  This also means that there are slight gaps between the phone and the case along the top and bottom.In the end, I'm keeping the case because it still provides adequate protection and it does improve the feel of the phone.  And frankly, all of the other cases I've seen so far seem to have at least one slight problem with them as well.

Very slick! Even with dry hands. Other cases of harder material have groves or patterns this is just clean and smooth. I felt my phone was not in a secure grip even with dry hands at home...I will not use this case but rather one that is more rubber like, it should take a bounce better and sits better in my hand for sure.

I was recently forced to choose between the S4 or Iphone 5 for my upgrade as there was no quality alternatives i could live with. I chose the S4 and went on a buying spree for a boatload of accessories to try and help my transition. With my purchase of the Hyperion 5200 mah battery, the matching case made sense for continuities sake. Had no expectations, just bought it and prayed it would be sufficient. Well the S4 was tiny to my big hands, and that was a plus adding bulk to it, so that was a good start. Second was the grip and quality feel to the case. It just feels right. no need for E grips or anything it never slips from my hand or sticks in my Velcro pouch/belt clip like it will be difficult to remove.It will protect my phone in my estimation from most above average falls, but not catastrophic falls or water damage IMHO. That is ok as i do not want a ridiculous armored case, just a solid case with a good screen protector, insurance(squaretrade) will take care of the catastrophic stuff. Coupled with Hyperion's great battery, this case is a perfect blend of great grip,good looks and great function as everybody at work loves it and the cutouts are perfectly cut for all ports making it truly unobtrusive.NFC worked great the two times I tested it with a co worker and my signal strength was identical with a coworkers uncovered S4 as well.

Inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box. The case came with a bumper that wraps around the outside edge to hold the case snugly onto the phone and add additional protection.  Once the case is on, it looks nice and adds minimal bulk while having a solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, it worked as intended. The case covers the back and sides of the phone adequately to provide good protection.  The addition of the bumper adds more stability and protection to the edges.  There are also holes for access to all buttons and ports and a hole for the camera. All buttons and ports were easily accessible. It also felt comfortable to hold.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice case that offers good protection to the body of your phone.

The phone doesn't become much heavier or bulkier with the case on, so if you aren't a big fan of heavy and bulky cases you might want to look into purchasing one of these. This case provides adequate protection on the sides of the phone, but mostly it is going to be protected on the back side of the phone. The bumper frame that goes around the case does provide extra protection to the sides of the phone, so that's a neat feature that many other cases don't have.

A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00E084XRO,Angela Streiff,"[0, 0]","In the morning I always listen to a local news talk radio station using the iHeart Radio application on my iPhone. I get much better reception using that app than I do with an antenna on top of a radio. So each morning I tote my iPhone around with me as I shower, do my makeup and hair, and get dressed for the day. This routine works, but the speakers on the iPhones aren't exactly great for listening to programming with the noise of the shower or hair dryer are going. The volume on the phone isn't loud enough to hear talk-radio programming clearly over the sounds of everything else. So I end up having to bring my iPhone way too close to the shower than I really should be, just so I can hear what's being said. Doing this, I risk getting the phone wet and probably ruining it. However with this SoundDew speaker, my phone is now at a much safer distance from the running water of the shower.Using this speaker, I am able to hear everything playing from my iPhone, and enjoy listening to my morning news with much more clarity and volume, since I can hang this speaker from a hook right on my shower wall. It pairs with the Bluetooth on my iPhone easily and while my phone is tucked away, safe from the water and humidity of the shower, everything playing from it is broadcasted right through the speaker.The sound from this speaker is quite good, and it's design feels very durable, not cheaply made. While it is water resistant (it easily holds up to water and humidity from the shower), the port coverings are not designed to make this 100% water proof. Splashes from the shower or being dropped in the sink it can handle. But I wouldn't plan on tossing it into the pool and seeing if you can hear your music from 10 feet below the surface. It might hold up through it, but then again it may not.There is an auxiliary port on the side of this speaker, so if you want to use it with a non-Bluetooth device, you can. You just need to hook up a 3.5mm audio cable between the auxiliary port and the headphone port on your device.Even the packaging this speaker comes in is nice looking. It's packaged in a thick clear plastic box-case, similar to the kind MP3 players are displayed and sold in. With all the color options this comes in, this speaker is a great gift idea for both teens and adults alike. I have this speaker it in the pink version, which is a beautiful soft rosey color. Great sound, durable design, good looking and I can listen to my morning news without ruining my iPhone, I love it!A sample unit was provided for reviewing purposes.",5,Showerproof speaker that saved my iPhone,1378857600,"09 11, 2013"
A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B00E084XRO,J. Chambers,"[1, 1]","I've seen a number of portable Bluetooth speakers that were advertised as being water-resistant, but the SoundDew is the first one that appears to actually encourage its use around water, based on its splashy (pun intended) product graphic. I accepted the challenge and rigged the speaker to hang from the shower head support while I took a shower last night. It didn't get any direct spray, but it got plenty of splatter and was thoroughly soaked after a couple of minutes. It worked fine, and since it was hanging vertically, the water drained freely from the openings in the grille. Note that the built-in hook isn't very big, and it's a closed loop. To hang it from an object, you may need a wire tie as I used, or a carabiner or something similar.The speaker paired easily with my Android cell phone and Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet with the device name &#34;SoundDew.&#34; The audio quality playing MP3 music was pretty good for such a small device. The specs don't list the output power, but based on my experience with other small portable speakers, my guess is about four watts. The volume can be controlled from either the phone/tablet or the controls on the SoundDew, but pausing and advance/return functions can only be done from the mobile phone or tablet. I also hard-wired the speaker to my tablet with an audio cable, and it worked fine. (A 40&#34; audio cable with standard 3.5mm plugs is included.) With the Bluetooth connection, the advertised range of 10 meters appeared to be accurate. I was seeing a good connection at 25 feet or so even through a couple of walls without any break-ups.As a hands-free device for phone calls, the SoundDew is easy to use and worked well. I used it to answer a call on my cell phone, and the clarity of the sound was very good. I had the SoundDew sitting flat on a table during the call. I liked the rubberized base that kept it in place and prevented marring the finish of the wood table.The user guide indicates that the SoundDew's internal battery can be recharged through a USB port on a computer (a 10&#34; USB cable with a Micro-USB plug is included). I contacted the seller's tech support and asked if an AC 5V power source could be used instead, and the answer was &#34;Yes,&#34; so I recharged the speaker's battery overnight with an AC wall charger with a 5V~1.0A output. Note that the charging port and audio cable port are covered by a water-resistant flap that opens to allow access.If you're looking for a small portable Bluetooth speaker, the SoundDew is definitely worth a look, especially if you need a speaker that will operate in a damp environment like the bathroom or kitchen, or outdoors near a lake or pool, or in rainy weather.A product sample was provided by the seller for review purposes.",5,A versatile speaker that performs in wet or dry conditions,1378857600,"09 11, 2013"

The manufacturer has pretty pictures on the web site but no copies of the manual cause if you saw the limited features, you probably would not buy.  The colors are cute, the handle nice too for hanging in the shower, so far battery life seems pretty good, YMMV.

A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B00E084XRO,Stephen M. Charme,"[11, 12]","I received this product at no cost from the manufacturer in exchange for writing a review and am glad that I did. Here is why I like this.1. This looks good, is light (.2 lb) and compact: the speaker has a 3"" diameter with a 1/8"" rubber border all around, is 1"" thick, and 4 1/4 "" from the top of the loop to the bottom of the speaker.2. This is just built for rough handling because the outside is mainly rubber and plastic.3. This is definitely water resistant. I used it in the shower, and then passed it under the shower head ten times. As water got into it the sound became muted--but came right back after I poured the water out. Then for good measure I ran it under the shower head another ten times. Of course a regular speaker would have been fried, but this speaker continued to work just fine.The included directions describe this as waterproof, but of course it is not. Big difference between water resistant and waterproof.Note: Be careful if you take this to the beach. All those holes are perfect openings for sand, and I can tell you from hard experience that sand can ruin electronic equipment just as easily as water. Likewise, salt water has a corrosive effect, and I suspect there is metal underneath all those speaker holes.4. I like the sound on this for a speaker of this size as well as the voice quality for phone calls. This is perfect for Skype.5. Since this speaker has only up and down volume buttons you can't control your phone or tablet. However, this has an incredible range of volume adjustment--I counted 15 different levels! As a practical matter just set the volume on whatever device you are using to the max, and then turn the sound down as needed on this unit.6. This comes with an audio cable as well as a micro USB charging cable and a hard plastic case that is handy for storage and travel. The included directions are adequate, but all portable bluetooth speakers work pretty much the same.Turn on the bluetooth on your device,  press the power button on this unit (in between the two volume buttons) to turn it on (you will hear an audible sound) and keep holding it for a couple of seconds until you hear another sound, which is the bluetooth pairing mode. On my phone and tablets I just look for SoundDew and then connect. Very easy. I paired this effortlessly with my iPhone 4S, iPad 3 and Nexus 7 2013 tablet. No codes required.Bottom line: Great for travel, the shower, or the outdoors in general (beach, lake, pool, and boating).Update April 4, 2014. My 1 year old grandson loves music. He likes to pick this speaker up and carry it around with him while listening to music. That's much better than letting him carry my iPhone. This speaker is rugged so no worries if he drops it.",5,Really like this,1378684800,"09 09, 2013"

This is sleek, shiny, and attractive, with smooth rounded ends. It's nice looking.The second thing I noticed and that I love about this is the display to tell you how much juice you have left in the Juice Box.  I hate it when I'm out and my phone goes dead, and I pick up my small charger I carry with me and it too is dead.  And it's dead because I thought it was charged when it wasn't. That problem is now solved for me since this.The third nice thing I noticed were the four attachments, one of which should be suitable for most devices.This comes with a silver-grey velvet pouch which holds the Juice Box, the USB cable, and all four attachments. It's extra nice because of the attractive clear bead which is used for fastening it. The Juice Box also has a built in flashlight, making it ideal to carry with you in the car or in your purse or pocket.I have so many devices that always need charging that having a portable charger that can handle charging two devices at once is a necessity.  I plug this into my computer at night to charge it and in the morning it's ready to go with me to the office.This is so much better than the slightly smaller external battery that I've been using, because aside from only charging one device at a time, and never knowing when it's about to go dead, this goes a week without needing to be charged and is good for multiple charges during that week. It's incredibly powerful and only slightly bigger than the one I've been using that always needs charging.I love this external battery since it seems to be the perfect battery that has all the power I need for a full week, the attachments, the great looking carrying pouch, the USB cable, a flashlight, plus the display to show the amount of juice it has left.  This is a feature rich battery for such a low price.  I've been testing the sample I was sent for review for six weeks now and it has performed flawlessly.

This one gets a higher rating since its only 2 dollars more but gives you 2200mAh more and an LCD display with a battery percentage.I have a lot of portable devices that require USB charging and therefore have tried a lot of portable battery packs.This one gives 2 ports. 1 port supplies 2.1 Amps and the other 1Amp.Pros:- Charges up fast- Charges your device pretty fast- Provides an LCD display with a battery percentage so you know the state of the battery, i.e. how much juice you have left and the charge status.- Has a built in flash light so you dont have to use your phone as one.- Comes with a nice carry case and a cloth to wipe the screens from your electronic devices.- Stylish design- Cable can be used for several types of devices. Has connectors for Micro usb, mini usb, iphone (both connector types).Cons:- During the first use the battery percentage was going down extremely fast. From 100 to 50 in less than 10 minutes. The second time I used it this didnt happen so perhaps it did not charge correctly prior to first use.- Horrible manual. I have tested a few OXA products and they all have horrible manuals. Generally it doesnt matter as the use is straightforward, but in this case I wanted to know how to turn on the flashlight. It turns out you press the power button twice fast. There is no indication of this in the manual and even if there was, trying to decipher what they are trying to say gave me a headache and I wouldnt be able to find it. They really need to find a better translator for their manuals.- The stylish design works against it in this case when you want to place it on the floor or table while using the flashlight. You will notice from the pictures that the location of the flashlight along with the flat surfaces on the two edges make it so you either cover the light or it shines up to the sky when you are using it. This is not a big flaw since you can either hold it or place it lying completely flat, but it is something you notice if you are trying to change a flat in the dark and would like something to shine in your direction higher up.

A3NXJDNTQK2YJL,B00E2TT8W6,"Andy in Washington ""Andy""","[1, 2]","I love external battery packs for my mobile devices. They extend the useful life of the devices and allow me to carry a few days worth of power- no more hunting down electric outlets. This is one of the larger capacity devices I have tried, and for the most part, I liked it.=== The Good Stuff ===* I like the form factor.  The unit is roughly 2 7/8  x 4 1/4  x 1 inches, and weighs about 8 ounces.  It just barely fits in a typical man's shirt pocket, but kind of a tight fit. The edges are all nicely rounded, and there are no protruding sharp edges to catch on anything. The black case is a fingerprint magnet, but that really doesn't bother me all that much.* It seems to have about the battery capacity claimed. It charged my iPhone4 from 4% to 100% while its stated capacity went from 55% to 44%. It also took about 10-12% of capacity to charge my Kindle (the old ones with the keyboard). The units battery capacity meter seems a little inaccurate around the lowest and highest 10%, so I don't know that you can extrapolate the results to say you can get 8 or so charges, but I have gotten at least 5 full charges of my iPhone and/or Kindle and had 30% battery left. I was able to charge both my Kindle and iPhone at the same time. If the Juice Box is fully discharged, it takes about 7-8 hours to fully charge it.* The Juice Box has a small flashlight, which I guess is sort of a requirement now, but which I hardly every use.  It is not all that bright in any case. The display is backlit, and easily readable in most any light. I am not sure it is really all that much more useful than the typical 5 bars of LED's, but it does make it seem more high tech.* There are two output USB ports, and their capacities are molded into the case. Good luck reading them, I couldn't. Not a big deal, since the display also tells you which ports are drawing power, so you can determine the high and low current outputs.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* My iPad (2nd generation) does not like this battery pack. The full 100% of the Power Box only moved my iPad from 15% to 43% charge. I don't worry too much about this, since no external battery pack has ever played well with my iPad, and many won't even charge it at all. No idea if that is normal, or if my iPad has a out-of-kilter charging circuit. Not a big deal, since the iPad seldom leaves the house anyway.* The instructions are laughable (literally). You will never learn how to use this device from them. Luckily it is quite obvious, but may be an issue for a technophobe.* The unit ships with a charging cable, which is a standard USB cable on one side and a series of adapters on the other. I have never been a fan of these types of cables, and just substituted the appropriate dedicated cable. The unit ships with a nice (fake) leather carrying case-although to be honest I don't use it because it makes the unit much harder to fit in my pocket. Note that the unit does NOT ship with a USB wall transformer, so you will need a power source.=== Summary ===* I have a number of these power packs, and this one is one of my favorites. It is small enough to carry in a pocket, but has enough power to get me through a two or three day trip.  I don't have the equipment to verify the 10,000 mAH capacity, but it is certainly enough to get a few charges for both my iPhone4 and my Kindle, which is all I really care about. The unit seems reasonably well constructed, although there is a slight internal rattle.=== Disclaimer ===I received this unit as a sample directly from the manufacturer.

Add the sleek, smart black and chrome finish, the twin ports, the flashlight&#8230;I&#8217;m hooked. Then toss in the LED data readout screen, and I&#8217;m officially blown away.OXA&#8217;s Juice Box S2 shares a lot of similarities with the S1 when it comes to the glossy look and even the flashlight: the former is a visual reason to pick this product out from the pack of other battery extenders, and the latter is a practical and smart deciding factor. By their nature, battery extenders are an intelligent add-on for anyone who uses cell phones, tablets, cameras, e-readers, and so on. But the flashlight is just plain smart: when the power goes out, and your landline phones die out along with the rest of the house, a flashlight makes darn good sense. This one is not very strong but, as I see it, it isn&#8217;t meant to be&#8230;it&#8217;s meant to get you around when the power is out, and that&#8217;s really it.The Juice Box&#8217;s real plus is the LED meter on the front that signifies the amount of power remaining in the battery; I found that to be a great addition. I know that, logically, a four- or five-light meter system essentially does the same, but I personally find that the meter, which displays the percentage of power remaining, is much more reassuring and informative.Again, there are two output ports (one at 1 Amp and the other at 2 Amps) along the right side of the Juice Box (depending on one&#8217;s orientation) and there is an input port for charging located between them. You should note that, with 10,000mAh of battery potential, it takes the Juice Box a LONG time to charge (more than 6 hours)&#8212;if there were one &#8220;wish&#8221; I could have granted, it would be that there would have been a more powerful charger included. But that isn&#8217;t a real complaint, as there are not too many times one has to charge it from a fully depleted state. My only other complaint is that there is no way to set the flashlight &#8220;up&#8221;&#8212;in other words, to point it at something without your hand holding it. This is a small note, hardly a real complaint, even.All in all, this is a terrific device, and it is one that I have no qualms about recommendation. As I said in regard to OXA&#8217;s Juice Box S1, just think of a loved one whose power&#8212;and landline phone&#8212;suddenly goes out in the midst of a medical problem&#8230;how much would you have given to supply him or her with more than adequate cell phone battery power&#8230;enough for several cell phone charges, in fact? To my way of thinking, this is a very small price to pay.TWO NOTES:Note 1: OXA guarantees its products for one year, and another six months if you call them to extend it.Note 2: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.",5,You Get a LOT of Battery at a Great Price,1395014400,"03 17, 2014"

The Ultrathin & Juice box battery packs charge via USB by plugging them into your computer.

If you need a flashlight it is there and fairly bright. It does not come with it's own charger so you will have to use your computer or purchase a micro USB charger that has an output of 2 watts or better (1 watt will work but will take forever to charge the Juice Box).This really is a great option for those that fly or are away from a power source for extended amounts of time. It will fully charge your phone or IPod approx 4 times with a little left to spare. Most tablets will get at least 1 full charge with a lot to spare (enough to charge your phone). It has two outputs, 1 and/or 2 watts for a total of 3 watts output so you can charge two devices at the same time. Obviously, the 2 watt port will charge the device plugged into it at twice as fast. The meter on the front is great because it lets you monitor the battery condition accurately and not just rely on four little LEDs like many other products.If there is a downside it is that even with a 2.1 watt rapid charger it takes a long time to charge the Juice Box from a drained battery.I have had it about 1 month and it has held it's charge at 100% the whole time.

The entire battery is enclosed in a plastic shell, and there's only one power button, which you can press to turn on the device, or double press to turn on the flashlight.

It also came with a charging cable with interchangeable plugs (for iOS devices & Micro-USB), and a nice handy travel bag. All of the above work well except for the screen which I found to have poor viewing angles. You have to look at it from a slight slant for the text to be clear. Nevertheless, this is only a small issue I have, and since the screen only displays the battery percentage, it doesn't matter too much.Onto the battery itself, it has a 10000mAh capacity-which should be able to recharge a phone multiple times. After a week or so of testing, it was able to charge my Nexus 4 phone around 3 times before I had to recharge the battery itself. This battery pack will definitely last long enough for most extended trips, and it's also great for people with multiple devices. One note though, is that it does take quite a while to recharge the battery. It took me around 8 hours to fully recharge it from 0-100%, so one does have to plan ahead.Overall, I really love this battery pack. I think it's just portable enough and it's large capacity allows it to last me around a week before I have to recharge it. That alone makes it quite convenient. I can just throw it in my bag and not ever worry about running out of battery. One thing I didn't mention much about was the flashlight, and that's because it's really just an average flashlight. It's not that bright, but it works. I suppose in some situations it might be useful to have, but I personally don't think it's necessary. I'd recommend this item for people who struggle with battery issues on the smartphones we use so heavily these days. There might be a couple flaws with this product, but it's still a very solid product for its price.SUMMARY==The Good==- Well constructed- Large capacity battery- Display shows % of battery remaining- 2 USB ports to charge multiple devices- Comes with a flexible charging cable capable of charging just about any device==The Not-So-Good==- Takes a while to charge- Screen has poor viewing anglesFeel free to ask any questions in the comment section below!",5,The battery pack I've been waiting for,1396051200,"03 29, 2014"

The LED light will indicate at what percentage power the bank is working off of, which is very helpful when on the road and having to schedule charges. My device came with a three-prong cable so I could charge my Samsung phone and my Samsung tablet concurrently. The Samsung tablet plug turned out to defective, so I had to use the plug that came with my tablet to get it to charge. I had no trouble charging my Samsung phone with the enclosed cable.While this bank needs 12 hours to fully charge up, it is much faster at charging up devices plugged into it. It took my phone 15 minutes to charge up from 93% to 100%. It took my tablet the same time to charge from 96% to 100%.This bank holds a full charge at least a day before it drops below 100%. One thing I did notice is that the bank will automatically lose 3% when a device is plugged into it.The device comes with a fitted felt carrying case. The flashlight is activated by quickly pressing twice on the button. The light isn't very bright, but helpful when trying to look at small electronic devices.

All the same pros and cons, but (currently) fifteen bucks cheaper.  The fingerprint magnet gloss plastic housing is not changed, still tending to get scratches and scuffs easily.  The little LCD has the same poor viewing angle and sensitivity to temperature.  It's best with the unit tipped back a bit from you, then fading out the more vertical it sits. Ok, two complaints. At least OXA had their logo printed a more ambiguous sideways, which doesn't look as off kilter as Maxboost's upside-down logo. Besides the list of devices above, I also tried it out with several different kinds of headsets, speakers, fans, lights, and more. Anything that charged or ran off USB power pretty much. Everything worked as it should, no complaints.  The included power adapter comes with several different tips, providing the needed cable for most common devices.Like the other model, I do like the OXA, the cheaper price being one of the primary reasons I'd recommend it over the Maxboost version.",4,This looks familiar,1394236800,"03 08, 2014"

It has a flashlight built right into the side of it so it has more than one use. The flashlight isn't super bright but good for little things like illuminating an area of a dark room or vehicle. You push the power button twice in order to turn it on or off. You can use the flashlight at any time even if you are charging devices. It also has a very nice LCD on the front that tells you the percentage of battery that is left in the juice pack. It also tells you if it's charging a device or being charged and it tells you how many volts and amps it's charging at. I think the LCD screen on this juice pack is better than any others that I have used so far. Most battery packs don't have an LCD screen at all.The OXA Juice Box S3 is a powerful battery that you can take on the go. It is able to be recharged via the included USB port and then you can charge your electronic devices from it. It holds a huge amount of power and maxes out at 10000 mAh. My iPad 2 holds 6944 mAh in comparison. This battery pack will fully charge my iPad when it's fully depleted and still have some juice to spare. I like the thick and soft sleeve that it comes with for carrying it around. The cleaning cloth is cool too and it can be used to clean the battery pack or your iPad or other device screen.Overall I think this is the best value on a 10000 mAh battery pack that I have seen.

Most other battery packs use LED indicator lights to indicate &#34;ranges&#34; of battery life. This is fine for most cases, but I enjoy being able to see the exact percentage of battery remaining. This battery pack also has a built in flashlight (double tap the power button to activate!)Anyway,10000mAh is enough to charge my iPhone 5s from 0-100% 5 times, or to charge both an iPad 2 + iPhone 5s.It provides two charging ports - 2.1A and 1A. Both ports are fine to charge most devices with, but tablets and modern smartphones will get the fastest charge if you use a 2.1A port.Unlike most competitors products, this charger actually includes a USB adapter cable (with interchangeable tips).Included tips are microUSB, Apple Lightning, Apple 30 pin, and miniUSB.It also has a nice little carrying case to store it in!Using the power pack is very simple! It comes with about a 75% charge, so you can either use it right off the bat if you're in a rush but i'd recommend charging it to full first. It charges using a microUSB cable. You can use the included cable and microUSB tip to charge it on your computer (slow) or plug in the cable to a USB AC adapter for a faster charge.To start charging, plug in your devices and then hit the power button. The display will light up and tell you the current battery percentage, and what is being output (5v 2.1A, for example).To use the flashlight, hit the power button twice (rapidly).I was provided a sample of this product in order to review it and provide my opinion.That being said, I really liked this external battery pack.

A1AQTH32IQ5JM0,B00E2TT8W6,Denise R.,"[0, 0]","So often I find myself away from home with a low charge on my phone, or on one of my other mobile devices - I find myself turning them off to conserve the batteries, only turning them back on when I need to make a call or use the device. Unfortunately that's a great way to miss phone calls.) So, when I was given this compact external battery to try, I was intrigued to see if it would eliminate those sort of problems. There's nothing more frustrating than needing to make a call or use my Kindle or iPod and finding them dead.The 10000mAh of this external battery means I can charge my small devices multiple times before having to recharge the battery itself. Nice not to have to worry about recharging it after every use! (For instance, it only took 14% of the charge to recharge my completely dead iPod Touch to 100%.)Another nice feature of this battery is that it comes with several adapters for the end of the cord, so you can easily attach it to any device you wish to charge.The instructions are on a tiny brochure, in tiny print and are in poorly-translated English. The brochure really needs to be rewritten - and the type size increased. My middle-aged eyes had a hard time with it, but I think people of any age would agree.The external battery came more than 80% charged, and it got up to a full charge very quickly after plugging it in.Despite the tiny instructions, it's actually pretty straightforward to figure out. To charge the unit, attach the micro-connector end of the cord into the unit, then attach the USB end into a wall charger (or, I suppose, a computer). It doesn't come with a wall charger, but don't we all have several of those around?To charge your phone, or iPod, or whatever, just attach it to the charger, and wait a while for your device to charge up. I've used it with my iPod, phone, and Kindle and it charged them all in very good time.Having the ability to recharge my phone, wherever I might be - even if I don't have access to my car charger or wall charger - is a good thing. With this unit, the phone (or, less critically, my iPod) can be charging in my bag, in the car's console, whatever I happen to be. With it, I'm never stuck somewhere without the ability to make a call, or to get online - or to read books on my Kindle.It comes with a soft grey drawstring bag to store it in when not in use, a nice little extra.The flashlight feature is also kind of nice...while I wouldn't use it as a primary flashlight during a power outage, it is helpful for seeing what you're doing when plugging/unplugging cables in the dark, or in low light.So, summing up, this charger works really well, and makes me feel more secure when out and about. I do hope the instruction booklet can be re-written though!

A1U5XB6PCIDLIK,B00E2TT8W6,Dennis Waller,"[3, 4]","I have two of these external batteries by OXA and after using them in the field, I would never consider going back out without them. In fact, we're getting another pair to take with us. Working off the gird in the middle of nowhere shooting for our latest documentary, it is important to have power for all my devices. For those who doubt me, I am listed on IMDB.com as Dennis M Waller and our latest project is the &#34;In Search of the Kushtaka&#34;  This is a real and honest review.So far, these OXA External Batteries have worked great in the field! From powering up the laptops, cameras, phones, even the IPod at night. We shoot a ton of footage and download it to the laptop to get a feel of the quality, to see if we need to reshoot anything. We do a lot of post production work in the field and unfortunately we're miles from any type of power so these play a very important role.The battery life of the S2 External Battery totally depends on what application we're using it for. I have a LG Flex and can go, even with heavy usage, up to 4 days without recharging. With the external battery, I can get it  totally recharged and it will last the duration of the trip. Anyone who is familiar with the LG Flex will tell you, the LG Flex takes forever to get completely recharge and the OXA external battery does the trick.With the laptop, again, with viewing videos, we get about 3 to 4 hours of use with the external battery. The great thing about that is these OXA products are a lot less costly than buying additional laptop batteries and we get the same amount of working time out of them. With the cameras, one recharge with the external battery keeps them going and there is still power left in the battery.One device that we use in the field is the Apple iPad mini and for some reason, these external batteries work best with Apple products as we get over 12 hours of heavy use with the external battery connected. In addition to using Apple and LG, there are Samsung and HP devices that require back up power and recharging, and OXA has not let us down, in fact, it allows us to get more work done than before.

ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B00E2TT8W6,D. Fowler,"[2, 2]","I&#8217;ve owned and tested a lot of battery pack and have not always been as enamored with the digital display type as some other people. One of the problems I frequently encounter is a very heavy drop in power in the first fifteen minutes. Yes, the OXA 10000mAh did drop in power, but not appreciably so. After the expected drop, it continued to perform quite well. I don&#8217;t run all kinds of tests, but rather run an informal one. I take a first generation iPad, usually with a somewhat depleted battery, to see how well it performs over time.One very interesting feature is that on the digital display, which indicates the percentage of power left in the battery, also indicates which port you are using. For example, I&#8217;m using the 5.0V 2.1A port. This is an important thing to know if you want an optimum speed charge for your device. For example, you won&#8217;t need as much juice for your phone and may wish to use the other port. These are individually labeled, but a bit difficult to see in some lights.A single tap on the button on the flat side above the OXA logo will light up the digital display. Two quick taps will turn the small flashlight on or off, whichever you prefer. The light obviously won&#8217;t light up a room, but will enable you to get around easily if the power goes out. There are four converters, but as a rule I prefer to use the cords that come with my own devices.What it all boils down to is how well the OXA 10000mAh performed. With 10000mAh you can fully expect to charge up a tablet readily, provided it&#8217;s not severely depleted. Overall I was quite satisfied with the performance, something I really didn&#8217;t expect. There are Samsung Digital cells and a premium chipset, which may have made a big difference. The only quibble I have is simply cosmetic. Black is a print magnet and there was a slight bubble beneath my digital display cover, however, I&#8217;m going to use it to charge my devices, not admire it.START:The iPad: 15%The OXA 100%15 minutes: 21% (OXA 87%)30 minutes: 28% (OXA 84%)45 minutes: 34% (OXA 82%)75 minutes: 49% (OXA 60%)90 minutes: 54% (OXA 50%)105 minutes: 60% (OXA 30%)120 minutes: 66% (OXA 24%)135 minutes: 73% (OXA 17%)150 minutes: 78% (OXA 8%)165 minutes: 84% (OXA 4%)180 minutes: 90% (OXA 2%)195 minutes: 95% (OXA 2%)205 minutes: 96% (OXA 0%)FEATURES:&#9658; Samsung Grade A cell and premium chipset ensure high quality&#9658; Above 500+ recharge cycles over the life of the battery&#9658; Digital screen to display the battery status when charging&#9658; 2 USB ports allows to charge 2 devices at the same time&#9658; Built in LED flashlight provides light when you need itSPECS:WHAT&#8217;S IN THE BOX:&#9658; Power bank&#9658; Micro USB wire&#9658; 4 x Phone converter, including 30-pin&#9658; User manual&#9658; Travel pouchSPECS:&#9658; Model: OXA 10000&#9658; Cell type: Li-Polymer battery&#9658; Capacity: 10000mAh&#9658; Input: 5V 1.5A&#9658; Output: USB1: 5V 1A; USB2: 5V 2.1A&#9658; Size: 4 1/8&#8221; x 2 2/8&#8221; x 7/8&#8221;&#9658; Net Weight:CERTIFICATIONS:CE FCC RoHsCOMPATIBILITY:Apple iPhone 5, 4S, 4, 3, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 1, 2, 3; Nexus; HTC One, Sensations G14 XE XL, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10; LG Optimus; PS Vita, GoPro; Nokia N9 Lumia 920 900 / Blackberry Z10 / Sony Xperia Z; ZTE; T-mobile, VerizonSample provided for review.",5,The OXA was unexpectedly a solid performer ...,1390435200,"01 23, 2014"

A36K2N527TXXJN,B00E2TT8W6,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"[2, 2]","The bottom line on this OXA Juice Box S2 battery is this: it works. In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's capacious, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external batteries that I've come across in terms of capacity (with impressive 10,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than most of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 4S, iPhone 5S, Kindle Paperwhite, Mobee Magic Bar, Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generation iPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged OXA battery. I was also able to charge my iPad completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with a micro USB cable that allows you to charge it by either connecting it to a computer or a stand-alone USB charger. The battery looks stylish and elegant. There is no doubt in my mind which device the OXA designers paid a lot of attention to details with this battery.There are a couple of design features that would make this battery pack even more appealing to me. I wish it had retractable prongs that would allow it to be directly charged from a wall socket. Even more so, I wish it had an attached micro USB cable, or even better a Lightning cable. Unfortunately, this would probably significantly increase the price of such a battery (especially when the Lightning cable is concerned), but such a battery/charger would indeed be a perfect on-the-go power supply.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****",5,Powerful Compact Battery,1398384000,"04 25, 2014"

Beside the item and a request to review I received no other direction, or how to rate it.I've used a few other backup/emergency batteries.  My previous favorite was a New Trent Power Pack.  This item stacks up pretty close, so I'm going to tell you what I really like about this one.* Battery Size. 10,000mAh.  This is quite huge, meaning you should be able to get an iPad charge, or a couple of iPhone charges out of it.  They make batteries that are larger (the Newer Tech comes in just over 11k mAh)  but I think this is roughly a good size for it.  This back is thinner and longer instead of the alternative chunkier square.  I prefer it.* LCD - Shows if it is charging or if it is powering something, that doesn't really matter.  The part you want to know is the percent.  This shows how much battery life is left.  So so so much better than 2-3 lights that show you have much battery is left.  Love love this feature.* Two USB Ports, including one 2.1amp port.  This means you can easily charge two things at once, which is great, but also for iPads and other electronics that need more juice quicker, you can use the 2.1amp usb port and actually charge them quick.* Charge by USB.  This one seems simple, but a lot of battery packs have 'wall wort' adapters that you have to bring with you as well in order to charge the backup battery again.  This means more in your suitcase.  This battery can be charged with a micro usb cable (and in fact includes said cable, more on that later).* Gimmicky but kind of nice is the LED light, it's not very bright, but it works.  Tap the power button twice to activate.* Comes with cheap drawstring bag, cheap cleaning cloth, and one usb -> XXXX cable.  This is a cable that can be attached to one of four included tips (old iPod 30 pin, new lightning connector, micro usb, mini usb).  If you need all these cables, it could save you some space to just use the tips.  I've generally found that they will only charge, so if you carry a lightning cable in case you need to use it to connect the phone, this isn't a suitable replacement.  For simply charging, it can be quite easily.  All I used including the lightning one worked great, micro usb one works great to charge the battery with).",5,Great Battery Pack,1394755200,"03 14, 2014"

The LED display is very easy to read which comes in handy when you need to see how much battery you have left. It arrived charged to 84% so it didn't take much longer to finish topping off the charge.The little flashlight takes two pushes of the button to turn off and on. It's not very bright, but like the light on a cell phone would work good enough in a pinch.The instructions are written in very small print, making it quite hard to read, I just squinted and tried to read the important parts. I haven't followed grammar rules much since my school days, but I still found myself giggling a bit while reading through the instructions. :)I like how you are able to charge two items at the same time, like cell phone and tablet. 4 extra tips are included along with the cord. More than enough for all the different types of electronics used on a daily basis. It does charge slow and seems to drain quickly, maybe it will hold a charge longer after it goes through a few charging cycles?A nice silver draw string bag is included to store the battery and all the tips.

AT53ZTTO707MB,B00E2TT8W6,I Do The Speed Limit,"[0, 0]","I've been experimenting with a lot of external batteries lately. Wow! There are so many from which to choose! What is different with this one? One thing: It weighs a tad bit less than the other 10000mAh batteries that I have. (8.0 ounces, where another is 8.35 ounces.) And, at the writing of this review, it is less expensive. (Of course, that can change in a heartbeat...) But, at the moment, that is a very good thing!Do you need this size of a battery? You do if you take road trips, especially during bad weather; if you travel by plane; if you spend days out in the outdoors. If you don't mind carrying around an extra half pound of weight, I recommend buying the largest battery you can find and can afford. I keep a 15000mAh external battery in the console of my truck. Peace of mind is priceless. With the winter storms we've been having lately, who can debate that?This battery charges quickly and stays charged for weeks. That, also, is a great feature when you don't plan on using it daily. (To keep your battery in peak performance, you should plug it in every few months, no matter what.)To give you a &#34;ball park&#34; estimate of what a full charge of an 10000mAh charger will give your phone (there are variables): Somewhere around 35 hours of talk-time or 44 hours of web browsing.More good features:--The digital display is easy to read. It will tell you the percentage of charge left. While it is charging, it will tell you the status of charge for each port.--Got to love the extra feature of a flashlight.--Besides the usual USB cable, it comes with four power adapters.--It comes with a decent draw-string gray velour pouch.What's not so great?--The ON/OFF switch doesn't respond consistently.--Even with a magnifying glass, the instructions are impossible to read.

This is a nice feature, and was useful in the testing I did for this review.When I received this charger the display showed a charge of 50%. I plugged it into a household-current USB charger, and found that it took 7 hours before the display showed 100%. So according to a straight extrapolation, it will take 14 hours to recharge this battery if it's fully drained.Next I drained my iPhone 4 battery down to 5%, then plugged it into the OXA battery to recharge. Getting the iPhone up to 100% took 2.5 hours, and at that point the OXA battery showed it was down to 80%. So again according to a straightforward extrapolation, I should get about five full recharges of my iPhone  from this OXA battery.I'd say that's pretty good performance for an item that costs only $24.00 (the Amazon price as of this writing).The velvet bag that comes with this item is nice, though it would have been much better if it had a side-pouch to hold the cable and adaptor plugs. As it is, you can drop the cable and adaptors into the bag first, followed by the battery itself.

Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. The small size is great for packing and in all the power banks I have seen with this much power, the Jupiter is the smallest.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 10.1 ounces and measures only 0.7&#8221; X 2.5&#8221; X 3.8&#8221;.  It also comes with an emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful (Note: this uses power quickly) and a travel pouch. It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device as the kit also includes a cord that that has one end as an USB plug and extends to three other plugs (2-micor USB&#8217;s and a 30-pin).This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/1.0A charge for most other devices.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%).

When my review sample arrived it looked more like a desktop size MP3 player than a battery pack. Since the product specifications cover the dimensions and capacity I will not repeat those.My take on this is that it's about mid range in capacity (believe it or not there are packs that are double this one's capacity on the market), but rock solid and priced well below the ultra-high ones.I love the display that shows at a glance the remaining power, as well as the integrated protection. This battery has circuitry that will prevent over charge, over current and short circuit protection. I paid a small fortune for both my tablet and phone, so this set of features increases the value to me.While I literally had to read the instructions with a magnifying glass (a peril for we senior citizens) they were clear and contain information that would warm the heart of any geek. For one thing, there is a formula that every manufacturer should include with these. I will provide it at the bottom of this review because some folks hate math. I will say that the TRUE output capacity of this battery is about 6600mAh. Compare that to these numbers of actual device capacities and use times of some popular phones and tablets:Samsung Tab 3 10.1 6800mAh battery with about 7 hours use time.Samsung Galaxy Note 3 3300mAh battery with about 6 hours use time.Apple iPhone 5S 1560mAh with about 8 hours use time.Apple iPad mini 4490mAh with over 12.5 hours use time.Apple iPad 2 6930mAh with about 10.5 hours use time.Even without using the formula it's easy to see how much extra use this pack adds. I mentioned in the title that this is excellent for first responders as well as power users (or campers, hikers, etc.) One feature is the large blue lit display that shows the percent remaining power. In an emergency that alone can make a difference by showing the time on scene of connected devices. The flashlight that is integrated into the case is another feature in that scenario. It's not particularly powerful, but could make a difference in some situations.The bottom line, though is the price. If you toss out everything I love about this pack it's still a value and that is the real reason I awarded it five stars.If you are interested in the formula I mentioned in the review:(battery supply voltage x battery capacity) x 0.9/battery output = the approximate output capacity.This accounts for losses through heat, wear and other factors (the 0.9 coefficient).

When I opened the package the charger displayed 54%, so I plugged it in to a wall adapter and two hours later it was up to 80%.  My iPad needed recharging at that time so I hooked it up, and it charged it up to about 85% before the charger ran out of juice.  I am assuming from that experiment it would fully recharge an iPad when it is at 100%.I can see where the flashlight might be handy during power outages also, and there are several adapters to fit different devices.  Overall, a nice product, and my only complaint is the extremely unhelpful instructions.  English is obviously not the writer&#8217;s first language, and the wording is so garbled, no one would be able to follow (most of it made the product sound slightly dangerous).

I have a Samsung Galaxy Ace and while I love it to bits it burns through power very rapidly. I have two spare batteries that I keep fully charged, but with my addiction to my phones E-reader and the constant camera and mobile internet use, I still need to take every opportunity to find access to a plug socket at every opportunity and keep the screen brightness low as possible otherwise even three batteries can feel the strain. The trouble is on occasion I cannot score myself a table seat on a train with a socket or worse yet I'm travelling by bus and theres no socket at all. I've had power packs before that have served their purpose, one even had a solar charger on it, but they have often been too bulky for my needs.This device solved that. It does not hold it's juice as well as bigger devices and it can only really offer one or two charges of my phone while i'm on the go, BUT it's actually very portable indeed. It's about the size of a pack of 20 cigarettes and very light. It comes with a nice little carry case and fits into the side pocket of my man bag with no problems. My previous power bank actually came with it's own holdall so this was a refreshing change.If your after something to charge larger devices like a laptop or kindle my advice would be to look elsewhere. If your looking for extra juice for your phone however this does the trick nicely. The backlit screen is clear and easy to read as well.My only other complaint would be that the printing on the instructions is FAR TOO SMALL. My eyesight isn't too great and I couldn't read them.

Charging my Nexus5's standard battery by 70% used up 37% of the powerbank's self-reported capacity.Besides capacity, the killer feature here is the LCD readout. Rather than 3-4 LEDs offering an approximation of remaining charge, a backlit LCD shows the precise remaining charge. The reading seems accurate, although when powering on, the powerbank can take a few moments to display an updated charge level (or needs a load to be attached for charging before updating the capacity readout).Unfortunately, I found the powerbank retained charge very poorly, making its high capacity less useful. After being fully charged and stored at room temperature, the battery was down to 47% after only 3 weeks. A li-ion battery ideally shouldn't loose more than 1% of its charge daily.The hard plastic shell is likely part of why this unit doesn't weigh much, but it's a magnet for finger-prints. Despite judicious use of the included microfiber cloth, it quickly ends up smeary and unattractive. This unit begs for a better coating, or a metal case.There's one microUSB power input, two USB power outputs, and a usably bright integrated LED flashlight. The power switch has smooth play. A case, a short USB cable with adapters, and cleaning cloth are included.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]This OXA unit is one of the higher-powered powerbanks on the market, in an unusually small form-factor and modest price.

A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,B00E2TT8W6,RatherLiveInKeyWest,"[1, 1]","I like this OXA external battery charger; it is priced very well as compared to others, seems to be well constructed (notes that it uses Samsung cells, which have a reputation as being the best), allows two devices to be charged at a time, and has a bright digital display that keeps you informed of its power status.This external battery comes with a cord that has a fitted end, allowing its four adapters to be exchanged as needed. My son and I tested these adapters using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.Packaging was simple - a form-fitting plastic tray with the accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag - and it was easy to open. Even though this battery pack has an amazing capacity - 10,000 mAh - it is still of very convenient size (approx 4.25 inches long x 2.8 inches wide x .9 inches thick) and weighs just 7.9 ounces.To see what it looks like, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page and look for the pictures I uploaded. The pictures may be found on that main page by scrolling down to where the ""Most Helpful Customer Reviews"" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the ""Product Images From Customers"" section.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and let it charge until 100% full which took about 4 hours to complete. The unit's digital display is outstanding; it is very easy to read with large, black LCD numbers which stand out nicely against its light blue background color.Operating this unit is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to one of the ports with the USB cable and proper fitting (or just use your device's USB cable -- that works perfectly too). Its ease-of-use is a good thing because the ""Manual"" that comes with it is so small, and written in such broken English, that it really is not usable. Good thing is that I relayed this to OXA via email, and already received a reply that they are working diligently to improve the manual. I think that OXA's customer service philosophy is top-notch.The storage capacity of this battery is outstanding and the charging times we experienced were flat out impressive. We tested it with a Samsung S3, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung Illusion, Samsung Reality, iPhone 5C, a Kindle Paperwhite and a Kindle Fire... and a typical example was when the Samsung S3 was boosted from 17% to 99% in about 20 minutes using the 2A port. Charging times using the 1A port were about twice that of the 2A port, but that makes sense and still the times were equal or better to what we get through our wall outlet adapters.We drained the Samsung S3 three times and recharged it with the battery, never needing to recharge the battery itself... it still had 37% showing on the digital display even after all the use. As is typical, the phones did get a little warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger, and the battery pack did not seem to heat up at all. Other than the odd manual, the only issue we came upon was that the unit's micro fitting would work fine in all phones with that port except for the Samsung S3 -- but that really was not an issue at all as we just connected the phone's regular USB charging cable to the battery pack and it worked perfectly.The title of the item on the Amazon sales page includes ""18M WTY"" which seems to infer that OXA provides a 1.5 year warranty; the item's box also notes ""Like us on facebook... within 30 days from purchase and your unconditional warranty will auto extend to 18 months"". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.This type of portable power for this price? What's not to like?

A1UWSU5ETQRQKX,B00E2TT8W6,"Robert J. Newell ""Bob""","[1, 3]","This is the external battery I've been looking for. It has high capacity, stable and predictable operation, and good portability. It's not really pocket size but certainly goes in a briefcase or larger purse with no difficulties.With a 10000 mAh capacity, allowing for typical operational efficiencies, you get about 8000 mAh of actual charging. That will give one to one and a half charges to a tablet and about four charges to a smartphone (there are wide variations, of course, depending on the devices in question). I won't repeat some of the detailed tables present in other reviews, but I'll recap my experience and then discuss a couple of use cases, one of which I consider very important.On a one-amp USB charging circuit, the battery charges in about 12 hours, which is what I would expect. It's a &#34;long overnight&#34; charge, but it isn't something you have to do all that often.I then used the battery to charge my smartphone and a couple of auxiliaries (a small portable speaker, etc.). I used nothing but this charger and used my devices in my typical manner. The battery pack lasted exactly a week before being fully discharged. A week--- that's an amazing length of time, but consistent with what I would expect based on capacity. A week of charging with no need for an AC circuit--- think about that.Of course I didn't have a tablet and that would have discharged the battery pack much more quickly. But here's the real point. If you're going away for a long weekend or even up to a week where there's no electricity, you're covered, and 11 ounces of additional weight won't be a problem. (Such locations may or may not have cell phone service but that's another issue.) But there's something even more important.Suppose there's a hurricane or a big storm coming. Power can be off for days, although cell phone service is usually a high restoration priority. Get set by ensuring that this battery pack is charged. You'll have as much as a week before you have to worry about a dead phone. Think about how important this could be in an emergency situation. I wish I had had something like this when an earthquake a few years back knocked out power in Honolulu for something like 16 hours. You can bet I'm going to keep it at the ready from now on.The unit is easy to use with a small but informative LCD display (which turns off after a few seconds to conserve power) showing percentage of power remaining. These percentages are representative rather than exact but I found the display reliable enough in actual use. There are two USB outputs, rated at 2.5 amps and 1.5 amp. I had no problem using them simultaneously. There is also a quirky but usable flashlight function. It isn't a bright light but it will get you around in an emergency. There's one supplied cord which is a standard USB to micro USB. Other standard cables from your devices work with the unit.The only quibble is the instruction book, which is tiny and written in a version of English that no one can possibly understand. Luckily the product use is intuitive and the question section of this product page clarifies things a little more.Bottom line: this is a really good product to own, both for recreational use and emergency and safety purposes.

Since it is portable, you are able to carry this device with you anywhere you decide to go.OXA was very generous to reach out to me and asked me if I would be interested in trying this device out. Thank you to my previous experience with OXA, it was a no brainer for me since their products are always solid. When you receive this product, you will notice right away that it is packaged very well. So what is included the package? You receive the powerbank along with a USB wire that has a detachable head. This enables you to charge any device whether it be an apple product or an android device. The device has a very sleek appearance, the outer shell is crafted from polycarbonate and has a polished (shiny) finish throughout. My favorite aspect of the device has to be the display screen. Most powerbanks use lights to indicate the remainder balance of the device, however the display screen on this device shows the amount of power stored in percentage, which is really helpful since it is providing you with detailed information as to how much power you have left. Another nifty aspect of this device is that, if you click on the power button twice, it turns on the flashlight which is on the right side of the device.If you are someone who isn't very familiar with technical terms when it comes to technology, you might be asking yourself as to what 10,000mAh stands for. Well, in simple terms mAh is mainly used to measure the capacity of a battery. The higher the number, the more power it will be able to provide to keep a device running longer.Still confused? Well let me provide you with some examples.If you have a iPhone 4/5/5S, you will be able to charge your phone completely using this device about 3-4 times per charge.If you have a Samsung Galaxy Device, you will be able to charge your phone about 3-4 times.If you have a phone with a larger battery capacity such as the Galaxy Note 3 or LGG2, you will be able to charge your phone on the go about 2-3 times completely using this device.I tested this device mainly on my Google Nexus 5 which has a battery of 2300mAh, and I was able to charge it 4 times from one full charge on the OXA Powerbank.Overall for the price point, I think this is honestly one of the best buys when it comes to power banks. Not only is the price great, OXA also has a wonderful customer service team. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to write to me so I can help you as much as possible.",4,wonderful little gadget,1395273600,"03 20, 2014"
A4NCJATGZ3X8,B00E2TT8W6,SBno1,"[4, 4]","I received one of these direct from the company to try out. They have not asked for or suggested that I write a favourable review, they have left me to write what I want good or bad.In the box you get a lead and set of interchangeable plugs, a storage pouch and the power bank.LEAD & PLUGS - The lead has a standard USB plug on one end and a socket on the other that will take one of the plugs. The plugs are a range of plugs to fit an iPhone 4s and below, iPhone 5 and above, microUSB to fit a range of android devices and a USB-a that fits some of the older phones and Navigation devices. If you attach the microUSB plug, then the lead becomes the charging cable for the power bank. The problem with iPhones is that they can be a bit fussy over the type of cable you use. The supplied plug was a little stiff to get in, but worked fine on my 4s. As did the other plugs on an HTC Desire, Kindle Touch and it powered up an external 2.5&#34; drive. I couldn't test the iPhone 5 plug as I don't have one. The plugs are really incidental and a convenience, I still use my original cables where I can and there is nothing to stop you using your own USB charging cable.POUCH - The storage pouch was a nice touch, soft on the outside, soft on the inside. There is enough room to take the power bank an the supplied lead and plugs and you could probably squeeze another lead in if you needed to.POWER BANK - This power bank is solid block of highly polished plastic. It is completely sealed and the bonds are tight, so there is no danger of it breaking apart. on the side is a power button to turn the unit on and off, although it will power down if there is nothing attached and automatically power up when a device is attached for charging. A double tap of the power button will switch on an LED torch on the opposite edge. A nice little edition and there is a modest amount of light for a single LED. There is an LCD panel that is clear and easy to read. You are informed of how much % charge is left, which port is currently occupied (like you need to be told!) and if the unit is receiving a charge (flashes &#34;IN&#34;). The LCD panel will light up temporarily on a quick push of the power button or when a lead that effects the charge is plugged in or removed.Well this is all well and good, but how well does it perform?The Amazon item indicates that the battery is x times bigger than this phone or that phone, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will will last that many times more. That being said, from a full charge I was able to charge my iPhone 5 times (each time the phone was around 25% capacity, with one top-up at 80%), I charged up a TomTom Go720 from almost flat, a Kindle Touch from about 60% capacity and I was still left with 15%, which is probably enough to charge the iPhone again. Of course this will vary depending upon the device, condition of the battery being charged, ambient temperature and starting capacity.The 2 USB ports enable 2 devices to be charged at the same time, but one port is more powerful than the other (1.0A and 2.1A). All of my devices charged off either port including the fussy iPhone. I can only conclude that the more powerful port will give a faster charge time, but I didn't manage to run a comparative test on this. I would guess that larger devices would need the more powerful port.To charge the unit up, you can plug it into any standard USB port even low power ports as it only requires 1.0A. Charge time can vary, I used a mains powered 5v 1.0A port. I started mine when it was at 1% when I went to bed and in the morning (8 Hours) it was at 100%. I would guess if you have a fast charge port, it will be done in a lot less time.If I was forced to find some negatives I would be struggling, but I would go with:The USB ports are marked to show which is 1.0A and 2.1A, but it is difficult to read. That being said, the LCD panel will tell you which port is active when you plug in a device.The high polished surface shows up every finger print and smudge.This is a good piece of kit and would be ideal when out camping and away from power. Trekking and heavily using your phone with a danger of it running flat. When you want reassurance that you have a back up battery with you",5,Monster Power,1397260800,"04 12, 2014"

A3V79KXIY09MOE,B00E2TT8W6,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[0, 0]","Who hasn't forgotten to charge something before heading out for a road trip? Sure, you can have a car charger, but that will only cover one device. Maybe you have a USB charger with multiple ports, but that doesn't reach to the back seat and also limits you to charging items in the car. That is where the OXA Juice Box S2 comes in; not only can you charge smaller devices like your phone or iPod, but it handles tablets, too!ConstructionThe OXA Juice Box S2 (henceforth referred to as the JBS2) is a portable power supply that is made of hardened plastic. There is a digital display on the front that indicates the percentage of the charge that the JBS2 has remaining, as well as which of the ports are in use (e.g. whether the power is inbound or outbound). If you are looking at it from the front (the side with the LCD display), there is a power button on the right side of the unit; if you press it twice in quick succession a flashlight will illuminate on the left side of the JBS2. Two more clicks of the power button will turn the light off.Included with the JBS2 is a USB power cable with a receiver end designed to accommodate one of the four enclosed connectors: micro-USB, mini-USB, 30-pin Apple, and an iPhone adapter tip. Note also that you can use your own USB charging cable in addition to or in place of the one included with the JBS2.The port to charge the JBS2 requires the micro-USB tip. The two charging ports for your devices are (from left to right) 5V/21A and 5V/10A. Finally, there is also a cloth bag to use to store your OXA Juice Box S2.UseI will try to keep this simple by outlining my views in the form of pros/cons.Pros1. According to the instructions, this battery will last roughly three months between charges (with no use). I have had the unit about two, and I can attest that this is accurate. While that is not quite charge-it-and-forget-it, this feature is quite handy.2. When I used this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 from 5%, it only took about 22% of the battery charge of the JBS2 when it started at 100% charge. I continued using the device to charge my phone without recharging the JBS2. I was successfully able to recharge my phone from at least 40% to full three more times before I had to recharge the JBS2.3. While the unit is a bit bulky to carry in your back pocket as a battery backup, keeping it in a bag or backpack to charge your phone or tablet while out and about is a wonderful way to use this. Charging two items at the same time doesn't slow down the overall charging time for either device; while charging my Kindle Fire HD and my phone I noticed no significant difference.4. The interchangeable tips are wonderful in that you no longer need to carry a wad of cables around if you have a myriad of devices that require unique adapters.5. Recharging the JBS2 only takes about a half hour to an hour, depending upon the charge required. The only time that it took longer was after it had completely drained.Cons1. The adapter tips should not be left on or placed in a stressful position while connected to a device; they can bend and/or break easily. The micro-USB adapter tip especially seems to be seated in the plastic housing somewhat tenuously.2. While the storage bag included with the JBS2 is made of a nice quality of velvet, I wish that there was a separate pocket (zippered, if possible), to store the USB cable and adapter heads. Right now you can push them into the bag, but I worry about them falling out or being crushed in my bag if I am not careful.OverallI have found that the OXA Juice Box S2 is indispensible. It is durable, and while the adapter tips aren't as rugged as I would like, the ability to interchange them to handle the different charging needs for my devices is very convenient. When you include the fact that The JBS2 is capable of multiple charges for your devices before it needs recharged itself, and it has a handy display that tells you exactly how much juice is left, I can say that I recommend this item to anyone who has a busy life. Or, anyone who is notorious in forgetting to charge their devices, like me!**Disclaimer: This charger was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review. While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.**",4,All of the JUICE with none of the pulp!,1396915200,"04 08, 2014"

I've used a number of these battery packs and this one has some very nice features to go along with the expected functionality.The OXA Juice Box S2 has a 10,000mAh capacity - which is plenty to charge my phone and my iPad completely (at the same time, even) and still have a little juice left. Or I can charge my phone several times or I can charge my phone and a friend or colleague can charge their phone at the same time. Because there are two USB OUT charging ports (one 1A and one 2.1A), you can charge two devices simultaneously.It has a nice, illuminated LED display which tells you what percentage of a full charge the battery pack has. I love this! Much more precise than the ones that display 1-4 bars, 1-4 lights, etc.It also has a flashlight for getting your key in the door after dark, finding a pen in your purse, etc. It won't throw light for much distance but for tasks like I mentioned, it's great. To turn the flashlight on and off, push the power button twice in quick succession.The Juice Box also comes with a USB charging cable which accepts multiple tips for charging different devices. Included are a micro USB tip, a 30-pin old style Apple tip and an 8-pin new style Apple lightning tip. There is also a microfiber cleaning cloth, a lined velour carrying pouch and an unusable owner's manual (more on this later).The Juice Box itself has an attractive, glossy black case with rounded corners. The plastic is definitely a fingerprint magnet so if that bothers you a lot, this is not the battery pack for you.In testing this and a few other portable battery packs, I have been using it once daily for about a month, which is more than I might in normal usage. It has performed reliably in charging both my cell phone and two different tablets, along with Bluetooth speakers and headsets. I do notice that it is slightly slower to charge than some other battery packs I have used, but it's not so much so that it is a problem.My only big complaint is the owner's manual. This thing is unbelievably small with print that is so tiny, I couldn't read it at all. Personally, I find this ridiculous and I hope that OXA reads this and decides to remedy this. A black and white, Xerox copy in a readable size would be sooo much better than this tiny color manual. Save yourself some grief - enlarge and print this manual on your printer or at the local Kinko's. It's the only way you'll read it. Fortunately, these devices are all pretty similar so you can figure out how to use it without the manual.Despite the manual, with all the features and the 10,000mAh capacity, this thing is an amazing bargain at the current sale price of less than $25. 4.5 stars - I knocked off 1/2 a star for the pitiful manual.NOTE: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was neither promised or implied.",5,A good battery back-up with some great features,1396224000,"03 31, 2014"

This is an ideal battery pack to take on two or three day trips, as it has a nice mix of power, weight, and features.It comes with two output ports at 1.0A and 2.1A, so you have the ability to charge one or two devices at a time. The input to the unit for recharging comes from a normal micro USB cord. For charging other devices, there's a USB cord and adapter plugs for micro USB, mini USB, 30-pin Apple connector, AND the lightning connector.  Finally, there's a built-in flashlight that turns on when you click the power button twice. You may never need it, but it's there. All this fits in the included grey velvet carrying bag, which means you have a better chance of not losing the adapters.The feature I'm getting more demanding of these days (especially on larger units) is a digital display of the power remaining. That gives you more precision on how much power is left, and the Juice Box has one. I also appreciate that it tells you which port/power output is being used. The embossed lettering on the charger itself is a bit hard to read, so this display covers for that issue.In terms of recharging speed... My iPhone 5S charged from 32% to 97% in just over an hour, so that's exactly what I would expect. When I unplugged the unit, my overall percentage of charge left was 84% (started at 100%), so I could probably get around four full charges before I'd have to plug the battery back in. The recharging of the battery was a bit slow, but if you left it overnight, it'd be back to full power in the morning.I'd be perfectly happy taking this battery pack with me on short business trips or weekends away from home. It wouldn't matter if you had time or a place to recharge the battery, and it would give you at least three or four days of phone use under normal circumstances.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free",5,"Good mix of features, weight, and power...",1399075200,"05 03, 2014"
AAEVGE52KL0DJ,B00E2TT8W6,Tim,"[0, 0]","This is the most powerful of the OXA portable power supplies I've been asked to review so far, and it is by far the one I would choose  if forced to pick only one power supply for my own use.10,000mAh capacity and 2 charging ports (1.5 amp and 2.1 amp) mean that it has enough energy to charge any two phones or other similar devices at one time. The unit ships with a velvet-like bag, power cord and a few adapters. Quite frankly, I'll never use the extra adapters because everything I'd want to power with this runs off a USB cord; but I'm sure some folks will find the included adapter tips very helpful. The blue lighted charge indicator is a welcome addition over other lesser models, so you will always know how much charge is present in the power supply. The device also has a white LED light that puts out about the same amount of light as a cell phone flashlight app. Again, this is a feature I'll probably never use, but you never know when you might find yourself in the dark with nothing but your trusty Juice Box S2 to depend on for survival.I tested the S2 by attempting to charge my Galaxy Note 2 with the screen to maximum brightness while playing my favorite game, and the S2 was actually able to charge my phone about the same rate as my OEM charger does. Even with my phone charging, there was plenty of amperage available to my iPod Touch 4th Gen.The only complaint i have is that the S2 itself charges very slowly. The specs indicate that it only draws 1 amp, while it puts out as much as 3.1 amps. This means that theoretically it could be drained in one third the time it takes to charge it back up. This failing really is the only thing standing between this power supply and a five star rating. Still, it does work well and it does what it claims, which is always the most important thing ti me when rating an item. A quick look on Amazon shows competing models to be priced at or above the S2, which is also important to take into consideration.All things considered, I think the S2 is easily worth the current $24 asking price (at time of review), and had I purchased mine for that price, I'd be quite happy with the product I received.",4,Does What it Says,1394755200,"03 14, 2014"

But it's close enough!As with the 7800, this little fella incorporates a small bright white LED flashlight that can be toggled on and off which I'm still not quite sold on, but it's there if you need it.The best upgrade on this unit though, aside from the increase in juice, is the little LCD screen which accurately shows the percentage of power left along with the voltage and amps currently being delivered and there's two USB outputs one offering 2 amps the other 1 amp. The bright readable backlight screen is a very much welcomed feature especially over less informative flashing LEDs.As seemingly with all Oxa battery products, this device comes with an interchange USB cable offering almost all popular connections from ipad to android to micro USB.

A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B00E2TT8W6,Wayne,"[1, 2]","I had high hopes for this product. On the surface, it seems to have a lot to offer compared to other similarly rated power packs. The last 10,000mAh pack I tested cost about $50 and lacked the LCD display that this has. Its instructions could have had more detail, but were at least cohesive. With a better price and more features, this one seemed like the way to go.Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. After charging a small Android phone, most of this device's charge was depleted. When I tried charging the same phone again the next night, it was only partly charged by the next morning. I was able to press this device's button and it started charging again. I wondered if it might have been user error of some sort, but my experience was repeated on later trials and also with a different model pack from the same company. After using this pack to recharge my phone twice, I tried to charge a partially drained Kindle Fire HDX. I ended up with the power pack going down to 0% but the Kindle never reached a significant charge. The previous brand of 10,000mAh power pack that I evaluated allowed me to charge my phone, then charge a depleted iPad, and then charge my phone again every day for the rest of the week. This one claims to do that, but didn't come close.Aside from the limited life of the charge, the device seems to be well made. The standard USB connectors are upside down though, so if your cable has an indicator, make sure to insert it with the symbol facing away from you. The side of the connector with the seam should be face up. The kit also comes with a cable with several tips, including ones for mini USB, micro USB and Apple. One of them is the Lightning tip, which I didn't get to check out, but you can use your standard Apple cable to be safe.I mentioned that the competition's instructions could have been better, but they could not have been worse for this product. Never in my life have I seen instructions so bad and it was hard to pick out comprehensible sentences at all. I can't understand why a company wouldn't hire an English speaker for a day rather than putting out instructions that were literally complete gibberish.On the plus side, it does have a good warranty. At least I think it does. It says that it has an unconditional warranty, but if you like them on Facebook, they will auto extend it to 18 months. If only the rest of the instructions could have been written so clearly.Note that this item was sent to me as a sample. The same is true for the competing model I mentioned.

AAOYA0DKWED4W,B00E2TT8W6,WombatComputing,"[3, 4]","Item was provided by manufacturer for review. The review represents my unbiased opinion.The size is just slightly bigger than my iphone 4s. I can get about 6 charges from the device, give or take, on par with what's to be expected from this battery. So it's great for in the car, when my phone is suddenly depleted from too much music or watching too many movies at work or bad reception.Charging Time: Charging time took a few hours for a complete charge, with the LCD screen showing such information. The LED flashlight is well placed on this. With the power button under the thumb, and getting a nice grip, the led is straight forward. It is quite bright.Ports: There are two ports on the device, to simultaneously charge 2 devices. There's a 2 Amp and a 1 Amp port. To charge the device, use any standard micro usb charger. The LCD screen is a big plus. It shows the percentage of battery remaining and which port is drawing power. It's also backlit for when you need to see in the dark.Design: The best thing about this device I would say is the power button. The power button is on the side, so out of the way and can't be accidently depressed easily when in a bag or your pocket. The button is depressed into the device a bit, so that it makes any accidental activation of the device harder. The device is sleek black. Glossy finish, smooth to the touch. It comes with a wipe cloth in the carrier bag, so you can keep it looking sleek.Other things: The package came with a holder for the battery pack, enough to fit the battery pack an da few cables. Speaking of cables, this battery pack came with a cable that has a 30pin iphone and a micro usb port.The flashlight feature doesn't require the device to be on. It requires a double press of the power button to turn on and a double press to turn off. The light is quite bright. I'm quite impressed by the brightness of this flashlight. It actually is now my go to flashlight when I travel. I use the flashlight as a backup on cruises. After the Carnival power outages on the ship, these battery packs are a lifesaver. Great in case a complete power outage occurs on the cruise, as it has a flashlight and limited power for charging a phone.Highlights for this battery pack include the LCD display screen, two ports, flashlight, and great power button design.",5,Sleek Power Bank,1400025600,"05 14, 2014"
A3JWD0WQ3VEZEX,B00E2TT8W6,"Wood B. Hermit ""Seeker of the one pure and cl...","[0, 0]","This OXA Juice Box S2 10000mAh Safe External Battery arrived well packaged and with a basic USB cable as well as all the connectors that you are likely to need on a daily basis. The glossy black surface will more than likely be something of a fingerprint magnet during use, but that's not really an issue of any importance to me.An AC adapter was not included, but then you very likely already have more than one of these readily available: just use the one provided with your cell/smartphone or tablet. These adapters nowadays are all invariably of a modular design with a detachable USB cable of some sort. That's what I did, no problems whatsoever.Upon receipt my external battery had about a 39% residual charge so I plugged its 5 V input outlet into AC power and let it get fully charged overnight to see what is could do the next day.1) The next day I first plugged my partially depleted (42% charge remaining) Motorola Moto X smartphone into the lower amperage outlet (1.5 A) of the fully charged OXA juice box and my phone's battery was once again at 100% capacity about 1.75 hours later. Doing this took the mobile OXA battery down to a 76% remaining charge.2) Then I plugged a partially depleted (52% charge remaining) Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 into the higher amperage outlet (2.0 A) of the now also partially depleted (76% charge remaining) OXA battery and my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 was once again fully charged about 2 hours later with a 19% residual charge still left on the external battery.3) Charge retention over time: After having fully charged this battery to the 100% level on the illuminated display and then turning it off and just letting it sit unused for 2 weeks it lost 5% of its charge, 95% left.I have not attempted charging two devices simultaneously - something which this OXA juice box is supposed to be able to do - since this really does not reflect my personal real life use of such a device. By far my most likely use will be limited to ensuring that reserve power is available for my smartphone when an alternative option of some sort (including a car charger) is unavailable or there is a power outage. Thus, this external battery works fine for me.The digital display with blue backlighting is a very nice feature and lets you easily monitor both the gradually increasing charge percentages when the battery is being charged via AC or a computer via USB (notably longer charge time) as well as the decreasing charge percentages when the battery is being depleted to recharge your device(s).The display and thus the device itself turns on easily (digital display illuminated in blue) with a single press of the silver button located on the side of the battery. A single longer press of this same button will turn the display and the external battery off. Two quick presses of this same button will either turn on or turn off the small integrated LED flashlight which is located on the side directly opposite this controlling button. The flashlight dos not provide a great deal of illumination, but in an emergency or perhaps to quickly find something that you have accidentally dropped it could come in quite handy.Although I was more than satisfied with the functionality and utility of this device as well, as the apparently more than adequate warranty (up to 18 months if you like OXA on Facebook), I give it 4 out of 5 stars overall, because of the absolutely atrocious documentation provided. Not only are the instructions extremely short (terribly small font!) and do not cover everything worth knowing about the device, but they are for the most part absolutely unintelligible! Although it's not that difficult to do, you essentially have to figure out how to use this device on your own.How hard could it be to get a native English speaker to write something that is both understandable and useful to your customers? The text enclosed looks like it was the product of a native Chinese speaker with Chinese/English dictionary in hand attempting to translate something into English for the very first time. For example, how does this excerpt from the manual grab you: ""Selection of charging cable charging cable with charging products first wife or the product is equipped with charging and discharging interface ..."" Did you get that? If you did, then at least please explain to me what anyone's ""wife"" has to do with properly operating an external source of DC power.Something like this makes a very unprofessional impression on customers and the public at large. Not getting a teensy-weensy two-page manual right is naturally going to make people wonder about the quality and reliability of your products. I would get this taken care of pronto and even can recommend a truly excellent company that provides technical writing/translation services just for this purpose (Idem Translations in Palo Alto, CA).Nevertheless, in this case the poor impression made by the included documentation is not borne out in the excellent quality and attractive price of the product/device itself and I definitely recommend purchasing one if it's something that fits your lifestyle.Note that the manufacturer provided me with a free sample for review.",4,Looking for juice?

A2EKBJB8H5MDD8,B00E2YI052,Cenile D. Mentia,"[2, 3]","These external battery packs are always a nice addition for anyone who loves using their smartphones. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all experienced those days when the battery icon starts blinking red and the day&#8217;s only halfway done. If you&#8217;ve used one of these before, this is pretty much the same thing, but if not, it&#8217;s pretty self explanatory&#8211;you can charge it through your computer&#8217;s USB port or a wall adapter, and plug the mini-USB side into the battery. There&#8217;s a non-intrusive light turns red when it&#8217;s charging, and disappears when it&#8217;s complete. The box says it takes around 6 hours to charge it completely, but it took me around 5 hours when I used a wall adapter. To charge your device, you just flip the cord around, plugging the USB side into the battery and whatever connector into your phone.This here is an external 2600 mAh battery(for comparison purposes, the iPhone 5s has a 1570 mAh battery & a Samsung Galaxy S4 has a 2600 mAh battery). What this basically means is that it should be able to replenish most phones completely at least once. I was able to charge my Nexus 4 with its 2100 mAh battery from ~15% to 100%, and the battery still has some juice inside.For a 2600 mAh battery, it&#8217;s surprisingly lightweight due to its plastic casing. It doesn&#8217;t feel flimsy or anything, but I&#8217;ve owned a couple of other external battery packs and they were all significantly heavier. This definitely adds to the portability & flexibility of the battery pack&#8211;just throw it in your bag or in your pocket for long trips or as a backup for those days when you use your phone more than expected.My favorite part about this battery would have to be the charging cable it comes with&#8211;as seen in the last picture&#8211;it&#8217;s a 1.5 feet USB cord with 4 interchangeable heads for different phones, including a mini-USB, an old Apple 30-pin connector, and two connectors for older phones (I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;re called). Unfortunately there&#8217;s no lightning connector here so the users of the newer Apple products will have to provide their own adapter or use their own cord. Anyways, this allows a great deal of flexibility, as you can charge just about any phone with these interchangeable connectors.There are a couple things about the battery that I didn&#8217;t care for too much. The instruction manual wasn&#8217;t very helpful (also contained lots of errors), and the keychain wasn&#8217;t too helpful for me, since the battery&#8217;s a bit large to attach to your keys (though I can see this being useful to others). Other than that, this is a solid product, especially for $11.Overall, I&#8217;d recommend this battery pack to anyone who&#8217;s looking for extra juice for their phones&#8211;it&#8217;s light, portable, and it does its job well. Feel free to post any questions in the comment section and I'll do my best to answer them.==The Good==- Lightweight + Portable- Well designed- Versatile charging cable- Does its job==The Bad==- Instruction manual poorly written- Keychain is unnecessary- No indicator telling you how much battery is left*Note that I was provided a sample for this review.",4,Surprisingly lightweight,1393459200,"02 27, 2014"

When it came in the mail I didn't even understand what it was supposed to do, but I realized I could plug it in to one of my chargers (which I use for my Kindle, blackberry, playbook, etc.) and it began charging. It was fully charged (red light went out) in about 5 hours. I unplugged it and then examined all of the connectors it comes with. Most of them I didn't recognize, as I have never had an iPhone, for example, and I don't use a laptop, but there are certainly connectors for any device you have. I sat down to read my Kindle and the &#34;low battery&#34; notice came on. Normally, this means that I have to stop reading, and go plug my Kindle into the charger, which is not a convenient place to sit and keep reading. Voila...a use for the power bank! I plugged it into my Kindle, and was able to keep reading while my Kindle completely powered up again! This alone makes it useful for me, but I can definitely see keeping it charged up and taking it with me for &#34;power emergencies.&#34; It is a great little device and I am happy to have it.

I currently use aVerbatim 10,000 mAh Dual USB Power Bankand I like it alot as it charges quickly, has a huge battery, and dispenses its charge equally fast.  However, I don't really like the size of the unit - its almost the size of my iPad mini - or the weight (about the same as my iPad mini) and thus I was looking for something a little more portable/lighter/smaller.I recently purchased the OXA 2600mAh SAFE External Battery as an alternative to my Verbatim battery and immediately liked its portability (it fits nicely in the palm of my hand and weighs about as much one of those cheap, pay-as-you-go, phones.  Although about 1/4 the battery life of my Verbatim, I figured it would be sufficient as a life-line on my overseas trips in case the batter on my phone was completely dead.  The OXA charges through a USB connection (which I plugged into a universal adapter and charged through a wall socket) and comes with several adapters which allows you to charge just about every phone or i-device that you may have.Although I liked the size and didn't mind the smaller battery size (10K mAh is really overkill for what I use it for), there were alot of things I didn't like about the OXA SAFE External Battery.  Chiefly the OXA SAFE takes FOREVER AND EVER to charge.  I mean we are talking 8-10 hrs when its completely drained.  By comparison, my Verbatim only takes about 2 hrs to charge and its an almost 4X larger battery.  Also the OXA does not charge your devices very quickly either.  As a test, I connected it to my phone which was at about 75%, 4 hrs later it was 100% charged.  Also the OXA only has one light (which is either blue - charged - or red - charging/low charge) to indicate whether it is charging or being charged so you really have no idea how much battery life you have left.  Although not super informative, my Verbatum at least has 4 bars indicating its level of charge.  Finally, the OXA comes with a keyring loop which I'm not sure anyone would ever use.  Being about the size of a can of pepper spray, I can't see any guy having this in his pocket all day long and I have to think that dangling from your keyring and bumping against various things can't do a whole lot of good for the battery in general.Bottomline: I like that its small, light and thus VERY portable. I like that it has enough battery capacity to completely recharge my phone.  HOWEVER, the slow to to charge it and dispensing of that charge to your electronics is a significant negative.  I think it puts out enough charge that I could talk on the phone while its being charged and not have it go dead again, but the trickly charge that it puts out is certainly sub-optimal.  The OXA has value to me as a life line while traveling, which is why I gave it 3 stars.",3,Nice Small/Light Battery But It Charges and Gives Up Its Charge VERY Slowly,1393200000,"02 24, 2014"

It comes in a simple, black case that say&#8217;s power bank on one side and is white with the OXA logo on the other side. It&#8217;s a basic design but it has a keychain on the other end. I really like the keychain option so it&#8217;s always with you when you need it. I have used about 10 different battery packs like this and that was a new and interesting option to me. It comes with the usual USB cord that is used for charging the battery pack and also powering up whatever device you are connecting the battery pack to. It also comes with a variety of different adapters that can be used to power up different cell phones or other devices. It also comes with the adapter need to connect to the iPad 1 or 2. If you need to connect a lightning cable to it then you will just plug it into the battery pack and not use the included cable. You can more or less use it with any device that charges via USB cable.This battery pack won&#8217;t fully charge my iPad but it will give it a nice boost. It will allow me at least 2 or 3 hours of use before recharging again.

A1AQTH32IQ5JM0,B00E2YI052,Denise R.,"[1, 1]","Too often, when I'm out and about, I find that my phone has run its battery down, so I am turning it off to conserve the battery, only turning it back on to make a call. So, when I was given this compact mobile charger to try, I was intrigued to see if it would work. It's so important to have a charge on my phone when I need it.It comes with several adapters for the end of the cord, so you can attach it to any device you wish to charge.The instructions are on a tiny brochure, in tiny print and are in nearly-incomprehensible, poorly-translated English. The brochure really needs to be rewritten.But, it's pretty easy to figure out. To charge the unit, attach the micro-connector end of the cord into the unit, then attach the USB end into a wall charger (or, I suppose, a computer). It doesn't come with a wall charger, but don't we all have several of those around? I used the one for my Kindle. Charge it until the red indicator light turns blue. It doesn't take too long to do that.To charge your phone, or iPod, or whatever, just attach it to the charger, and wait a while for your device to charge up. It charged my completely-dead iPod touch 5G in less than an hour. And, it charged my phone from about half-charged, to fully charged, in less time than that (sorry, I forgot to time it).There is a keyring on the charger, though it would be pretty bulky to keep on a key chain in your pocket. But the ring may be useful to attach to a strap or carabiner in your  backpack, I suppose. (If this were small enough to go on a keychain, that would be even better! But as it is it is not too big and fits easily in a bag or coat pocket.)Having the ability to recharge my phone, wherever I might be - even if I don't have access to my car charger or wall charger is a good thing. With this unit, the phone (or, less critically, my iPod) can be charging in my pocket or my purse, whatever I am doing. With it, I'm never stuck somewhere without the ability to make a call.So, summing up, this charger works well, and makes me feel safer.

This OXA 2600 mAh external battery/charger is one of the smallest I&#8217;ve seen, both in terms of physical size as well as charge capacity. The battery looks similar in shape and size to an elongated lighter. The battery is charged from an USB port, and it comes with its own micro USB cable with several different charging attachments. You can charge it by plugging it into a spare USB outlet on your PC (slow), or by using one of the wall USB outlets from your cell phone or a similar device.I&#8217;ve been able to use this battery to fully charge a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and iPhone 4S. It took me a few hours to charge both of those devices. In order to charge an iPhone I had to use my own iPhone cable &#8211; Apple is very restrictive when it comes to allowing third party manufacturers using their proprietary designs.Since this battery is very small it is ideally suited for an emergency backup charging. It can easily fit in your pocket along with your smartphone, although I wish that it came with a small bag into which to put it.This is neither a particularly stylishly designed nor remarkably well built external battery.

AYG1U47VFZ165,B00E2YI052,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","For clarification&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;m not what I&#8217;d call a tech junkie.  Others in my family think of me as such (I spend an awful lot of my workday on the PC, and I routinely make use of smartphones, tablets, and other assorted gadgets and gizmos).  But if you&#8217;re looking for some type of quantitative analysis of Product A versus Product B, then the best I can do is compare for you as a consumer what works best about one choice over the other.  I can&#8217;t give you any kind of substantive breakdown on the technology used in assembling them.  Heck, in some instances, I can&#8217;t even quite tell you how they work!  What I can tell you is that, as a consumer, I know what I like, and I&#8217;m very vocal about those things I do.With that qualifier out of the way, let me tell you first and foremost why I&#8217;ve personally had to make use of products like AXO&#8217;s 2600mAh External battery.  One of the places where I go for periodic work tends to be in what I&#8217;d call a wireless desert: I get terrible reception, and my iPhone is constantly roaming to try to pick up local signal.  As such, the battery gets fairly low after about six-to-eight hours, not to the point of having the thing shut down completely but because I&#8217;m the kind of person who gets uptight about it then I prefer having a battery on-hand with which to juice back up.  Call me obsessive-compulsive about it, but that&#8217;s my cross to bear.Consequently, this is precisely the kind of product &#8211; small, convenient, and reliable &#8211; that I like to turn to when that happens (which is about twice a week).  Granted, there are always other options when I&#8217;m in a workplace &#8211; access to a PC to get a power boost, or even carrying along an AC charge cord (which I occasionally do) &#8211; but I prefer the independence of protecting my data from accidentally being collected on someone else&#8217;s hard-drive so the AXO product is designed with folks like me in mind.  It&#8217;s small enough to be carried on my person.Charge time states in the manual of six hours, and mine took a bit longer (about six-and-one-half) to show full charge.  No big deal so far as I&#8217;m concerned.Positives:First, unlike other manufactured batteries I&#8217;ve tested/reviewed, the OXA model is designed for greater flexibility as the provided USB cable can be used with different provided connectors.  The four connectors include heads that can be used with the most popular iPhones but also appeared to be compatible with some tablets.  (As I&#8217;m no expert on these matters, I can&#8217;t say which specifically.)Second, the OXA model is designed with a convenient key-attachment for those of you who&#8217;d rather keep it available within arm&#8217;s reach at a moment&#8217;s notice.  Because this is an electronics gadget and as such probably has some internal components that don&#8217;t need the extra jostling about or banging up against my heavy car keys, I probably won&#8217;t use it as such BUT I&#8217;ve already encouraged my wife to keep her few work keys on it and carry it in her briefcase.  It&#8217;s the perfect size and shape for that.Third, (again) unlike some other manufactured batteries I&#8217;ve tested/reviewed, the OXA model comes complete with an actual user&#8217;s manual.  (I can&#8217;t tell you how sadly rare this is.)  Info junkies such as myself crave those days of old when suppliers were actually obligated to give us some details &#8211; not just a few lines of description on the product packaging or refer us to some website wherein we can review posted information about what we&#8217;re using.  Granted, it&#8217;s short and sweet BUT it&#8217;s perfectly sized to fit in the small plastic bag containing the aforementioned connectors.  MAJOR kudos, AXO!Lastly, the model has a little red indicator light built directly under the opaque housing.  The light glows red while it&#8217;s charging, and it turns off when the unit is fully prepped.  It&#8217;s that simple.Negatives:The only thing that springs to mind after this initial charge and use is that the provided USB charge cord is relatively short (12 inches?).  In most cases, this isn&#8217;t going to be a big deal, but if I&#8217;m being perfectly honest about it I&#8217;d prefer to have something a bit longer.  I&#8217;m old-fashioned that way.  Also, the provided manual has some minor typos; sure, this doesn&#8217;t have a lot to do with the entirety of the product&#8217;s usage, but I always want something that makes sense when I read it one time &#8211; call me nave, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to read something twice to understand it perfectly.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Seriously, this is a great product, especially given the price, that I&#8217;d encourage anyone who might have even the most modest use to have in your possession.  If you&#8217;re inclined, throw it in your pocket, ladies can drop it in a purse, or businesspeople can toss it in a briefcase (along with the plastic bag of connectors OR better yet even pick up one of those small accessory bags to store it all in for convenience).  You never know when you&#8217;ll need the extra juice, and, when OXA makes it this affordable, it&#8217;s practically silly NOT to have one in your collection.  I have three, but I guarantee you this one will likely get the most use if for no other reason than it provides me with the most options.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at OXA provided me with a sample product after contacting me via social media for the purposes of penning this review; the providing of said product in no way, shape, or form has influenced my estimation.",5,"Smart Design, Low Price, and Easy to Use!

On more than one occasion I have found myself low on battery, or just flat out dead! This is so handy, I don't know why I never purchased one sooner.This is super simple to figure out. Trust me, you will have to figure it out because the instructions are not clear at all. I will get to that issue later....  Right out of the box I could tell what goes where and how to use it. I have charged this unit at least twice; once from my computer and once from my wall cell phone charger. Both charged the powerbank within a couple of hours. A red light tells you that it is charging and it goes off when charging is complete.I have charged my cell phone and my camera in the same day without having to recharge the battery. Neither were completely dead, but really close to it. I have also charged my Kindle using the cord that came with my Kindle. There are plenty of adapters, but I only needed one. I'm sure there are other products that could use the rest of the adapters. A blue light comes on when it is charging the cell phone, etc.This battery easily fits in my jacket or my purse. It is so lightweight that you can just keep it with you all the time. I haven't tried hooking it to my keys, only because I have 2 cars and don't want to forget it if I switch vehicles.I have never had the battery run out of juice yet, but I keep it charged up. The directions say you should fully discharge it 2-3 times to get the best battery life, and I'm sure I need to do this, but haven't gotten around to it yet.My biggest complaint is in the directions. Unless you can read Shakespeare or can decipher cryptic messages, you better figure this one out on your own. For example, the directions read &#34;Charging, the mobile power hosts a slight fever, which is a normal phenomenon.&#34; I take that to mean that it is warm when charging, which is normal.

For testing purposes I kept this in my bag to use so I could see how it handles the sort-of real world.In that she did fine.

A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B00E2YI052,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[1, 1]","Are you like me, do you get nervous when you see your phone battery dip below 80%? Well, that may explain why I have 3 separate portable power supplies. Now I realize not everyone is as anal about powering their devices like I am, but for those of you who happen to have a smartphone--which you totally rely on--without the ability to remove and replace the battery, you really need extra power when you need it--and you NEVER know when you'll need it. Chances are, it'll be when you least expect it. This is where the OXA Portable Power Bank really comes in handy.Another reviewer said they liked this external battery, but felt that it wasn't really for 'power users.' MY argument for that is: WHY did they get a 2600mAh battery then? My current cell phone battery is 1700mAh so I easily double my power with this device...if you really ARE a power user, then of all the different sized external batteries available, why did you settle on one so small? They have positively gargantuan batteries out there to choose from which are able to power not only your phone, but laptop and tablet and still have enough to get you through the day--so why not get one of those? I have a 3300mAh battery which works great, too--but isn't nearly as stylish as the OXA. Sure, style isn't always what you're shooting for, I get that, but as long as you're going to use extra power, why not get a battery that looks as good as it works? Just sayin'.After the initial set-up and charge, I have nothing but high praise for my Power Bank. It charges quickly, and powers my phone with all the speed of plugging it directly into a wall outlet--easily 30-40% faster than using a car charger (if not, it certainly SEEMS like it). I like the included key ring, too. While it may be a little too big for some to carry around on a keychain, it really isn't by a whole lot. Plus, I really like how the included charging cord isn't ridiculously long. One of my other chargers came with an obnoxiously long cord which seems to be always getting bunched up and tied in knots, even when I TRY to keep it from doing so. Annoying? You bet. I understand that some prefer shorter cords, and some need and even require longer charging cables, but honestly, for ME, this is just about perfect. I haven't once had to untie it from a knot which is a tremendous blessing to me--especially when I happen to be in a hurry.You have plenty of sources to choose from when it comes to external power supplies, in MY opinion, if you need an extra boost and you aren't a super-power-user, think long and hard about giving the OXA Power Bank a try.

One way to kill time is to use my phone for playing games, watching movies or series on netflix, checking e-mails and engaging in social networking sites. And before I even get to the place I work or meetings and lunch dates I almost finish the battery life of my phone. Thanks to OXA 22600 mAH external battery I can recharge it while I am out and about. I have an iPhone 4S and I get a full charge of battery life from plugging in this external battery. And because it is a 2600 mAH it usually takes 8-10 hours before I get a full charge if my phone has died completely, in other words, if I see a &#34;battery empty&#34; sign. I usually plug it all ready when it is only 30% so that it wouldn't take long for me to use it again. I can use it while I'm playing or watching. Another great thing about this is that I it doesn't have a button that need to be pressed before activating the charge. I hated buttons because if I accidentally press it, then the charging would stop without me even knowing it. GLAD it doesn't have one. All I had to do is just plug it in and voila! I can keep on doing what I am doing. I am actually impress how one time, I have a 50% battery life and after 30 mins I have 80%. I usually don't use up all the power of this external battery in one go. By the time I'm home I still have some power left. I didn't have to worry.

There are several devices like this one, similarly inexpensive and with never-heard-of-them-before brand names.This item comes with a key ring attached via a short lanyard, but because of the bulk of the charger itself (just under an inch square by 3.75 inches long), it's difficult to imagine anyone keeping it in a pocket with their keys. (Insert obligatory ""...or are you just glad to see me?"" joke here.)The manual, if you can call  it that, is in rather poetically indecipherable English: ""The mobile power has automatically end,block the host buill-in battery is fully mobile power red light is off , the charge will be its own end."" But no matter; the device is simple enough: A micro-USB socket for power-in, and a regular USB socket for power-out. There aren't any switches to worry about. The provided cable comes with 4 different interchangeable male plugs, including a plug for the iPhone 4 and earlier (for later iPhones you'll need to use your own USB-to-iPhone adaptor).This battery is rated at 2600 milliampere-hours (mAh). This isn't much -- it's about enough to recharge a nearly-dead iPhone battery once, maybe with a little left over. There are much more powerful external batteries available - theVerbatim 10,000 mAh, theAnker Astro 3E 10,000 mAh, and theEasyAcc 12,000 mAh Power Bank 4to give a few examples.But if you think a single recharge of your phone is all you're ever likely to need, if you aren't a stickler for prominent brand-names with a proven track record, and if this battery  stays at its current Amazon price of $11.00, I'd say it's a good deal.",3,"No powerhouse of a battery, but nice for the price",1392768000,"02 19, 2014"

This is the latter and at around ten bucks is a bargain if you are using one of the more power hungry phones like the iPhone 5S.Using the iPhone 5S as an example the 2600mAh capacity that this battery has will add about 150% to the use time of an Apple iPhone 5S, which comes in at 1560mAh. Conversely, it will probably not add more than two extra hours to an Apple iPad 2's internal 6930mAh battery.The above estimates are conservative and account for power loss from temperature changes, repeated battery use and other factors. Out of the box in a stable environment this battery should perform much better than my conservative estimates.Lower capacity is not necessarily a detriment because it is a viable (and small)  emergency source that will easily fit in a purse or pocket. In that context even a tablet user will find that it can add just enough juice to make a difference for a critical task. My reasons for awarding this five stars are:VALUE: at the time of this review this pack was hovering in the ten to twelve buck range, which is the price of two fast food lunches. Considering that it does provide a lot of use time to some of the power hungry phones on the market it's definitely functional. Do not forget that this is perfect for cameras and other devices, so it's handy on vacations, hiking and beaches.CONSTRUCTION: it's practically indestructible, with no real moving parts (although the input and output ports are exposed).VERSATILE: the included cable has removable ends and includes mini and micro USB ends, plus an Apple 30 pin connector for all but Apple's newest phones. It also provides a mini barrel connector end for other devices like a bluetooth speaker I own. It's an all-in-one solution as long as you are not expecting the newer Apple Lightning cable.SIZE: it's fits purses and pockets as I mentioned, and is a functional keychain as well. True, the battery is a oblong block, but the size does make it easy to find misplaced keys.I am thoroughly pleased with mine for the reasons stated.

Overall, the product has worked as promised, but I have a few downfalls with this product. First off, to be honest, ""Chinese/English"" wording was off in how to info. A little hard to comprehend, however not a major problem. This product does not work with all devices, in example my fiances Droid cell phone. Also, the battery did not hold a charge as long as promised. Other than that, this product works well with our other cell phones and my Kindle Fire. Portable is the key. Pun intended, as this comes on a handy key chain, and can be used while it is charging. Pretty nifty product, at reasonable price. I'm happy with it, and I would recommend for as a useful handy on the go gadget.*Side Note*I was using this product while getting my oil change and tire rotation. At check out time, the manager questioned what I was using, as he has never seen one before. He also was impressed!

The package also comes with a manual that seems to have gone through Google Translate a few dozen times in a multitude of languages ending in 'English'. I mean, this makes no sense at all!Now, on to the important stuff. I tested the battery several times. All the tests (10) average about 2 minutes of time per 1% charge point. So, it takes a long time to charge your device. Moreover, in every single test, the battery charged my iPhone up to 80%. It never charged more than that. Not being able to provide a full charge to your devices is an issue for me.This is good for emergencies and to have as a backup. I am out of the house and/or office all day long and I actually carry around 2 external batteries and an Energizer case (which is also a battery) to get me through the day.

Compared to other powerbanks I have (including other Oxa models), this unit it slower to charge itself, but charges up a load (discharges) at a normal speed.The 2600mAh rated capacity should be enough to top up most phones, but I found it only charged my Nexus5's 2300mAh stock battery about 50-60% (after several charge/discharge cycles). Most powerbanks can't discharge 100% of their maximum capacity, but less than 50% seems on the low side even for a budget powerbank.Considering how important mobile devices are to modern living, I really like having a powerbank in every bag I use (laptop case, camera bag, airline carry-on, etc). This one is kind of an odd size for me, but would fit well into a purse or glovebox as a ""backup"" when you need just a *little* more juice.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]I rate this 4 stars considering the low price and lightweight build, but with the plastic build and poor discharge, any heavier or more expensive would drop this powerbank to just 3 stars.",4,"hefty for a keychain, but good size for an emergency backup",1400112000,"05 15, 2014"

It is literally keychain sized (that said, it will be bulky on your ring, but you get a sense for its size accordingly) and holds enough of a charge to recharge your phone or Kindle 2 or 3 times. Actually, the only real knock on it is a lack of a charge indicator. That is probably the only thing I would change about this.You really cant beat its portability, and given it's small size and decent power, I have no problem giving this 5 stars.

A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,B00E2YI052,RatherLiveInKeyWest,"[0, 0]","This OXA external battery charger is priced well as compared to others in its 2600mAh capacity range, seems well constructed (uses a Samsung cell, which has a reputation as being the best), and is of a very convenient and portable size. At just four inches long by one inch wide & high, and only weighing 2.5 ounces, this backup battery is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.This external battery comes with a cord that has a fitted end, allowing its four adapters to be exchanged as needed. My son and I tested these adapters using multiple devices and had much success as summarized below.Packaging was simple - a form-fitting plastic tray with the accessories wrapped in their own plastic bag - and it was easy to open. If you would like to see pictures I took of it, please navigate to the battery pack's main sales page, scroll down to where the ""Most Helpful Customer Reviews"" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the ""Product Images From Customers"" section.Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our wall adapter (used my Samsung S3's wall adapter) and a red light came on; the User Manual indicates that the red light means the unit is charging, and that the red light goes out once the unit is fully charged. We let the battery charge until the red light went out, which took about 4 hours to complete. This device does not have a digital display to keep you informed of its power level, unlike its outstanding bigger brother the OXA S2 100000mAh battery, and I did miss having that display.Just like the bigger OXA S2 unit, operating this battery is a breeze -- just plug it in to charge the battery pack, then when you need it you just connect your device to the port with the USB cable and proper fitting or with your device's USB cable. We tested both ways and had no issues at all with connectivity; once connected and charging a device, a blue light comes on to let you know that charging is proceeding.The storage capacity of this battery is 2600mAh which is perfect for a quick boost but it not for multiple charging use without recharging. It is just right to help out in emergencies, and the charging times we experienced were good; on average, it charged our units at a rate of about 3/4 percent per minute, or about 45% recharging per hour from its 5V/1A USB output port.We tested this power bank with a Samsung S4, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung S3 and an iPhone 5C... and a typical example was when the Samsung S4 was boosted from 1% to 61% in about 80 minutes. One curiosity; the backup battery has a 2600mAh rating and the Samsung S4 has a 2600mAh Samsung battery, but the fully charged backup was only able to charge the S4 to 61% before being depleted. This may reflect that it was only on the power bank's third or fourth cycle and the load may move towards full capacity after a longer break-in period. We did not experience this with other devices we charged.The phones did get a little warm during the charging process, but no warmer than if put on its own charger, and the battery pack did get a little warm too -- but nothing odd or unusual at all. The unit's micro fittings worked fine in all phones that we tried, and the regular USB charging cables that came with the phones all connected perfectly with the battery pack too.This battery is very easy to use... and that's good, because its ""User Manual"" is small and written in severely broken English -- to the point of being very comical. OXA staff already replied to my inquiry noting that they are working to improve the manual, and I feel that their responsiveness and customer service philosophy is outstanding. However, I must share this one line with you from the back of the box: ""Warming: do not follow these instructions. may cause a fire, electric shock damage or other damage."" I am sure that this meant to start ""Warning: Failure to follow these instructions....""The title of the item on the Amazon sales page includes ""18M WTY"" which seems to infer that OXA provides an 18 month warranty; there is no further mention of the warranty on the item's box or ""User Manual"". If an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this unit gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.Affordable, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer.If you are looking a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then I recommend it.Go for it.",4,OXA 2600mAh Power Bank - Portable External Battery Charger - Single Port - Good emergency backup to have,1394928000,"03 16, 2014"

Not only do I use my cell phone to keep in touch with friends and family, but I also use it to for work related tasks. Now, as great and powerful cellphones are today, they do lack something very important and that is a good battery life. I have tried many alternatives such as carrying an extra battery, charging in middle of class, and going as far as carrying an extra phone to make sure I never lose contact with my clients. However, all those alternatives turned out to be a hassle. Eventually I came across power banks and decided to give them a try. So why did I decide to try this product? Price and size.The Oxa power bank comes packaged very well and looks very professional. I was kind of surprised to expect such presentation for the low price point. Once you open the package, you receive the power bank and USB wires to charge the device of your choosing. It does not come pre-charged, well at least mine did not. It took about an hour to charge the power bank completely. When in charge, there is a hidden LED light under the case that just springs to life, letting you know that the device is under use. There are many aspects of this product that one can cherish, such as the compact size that makes it easy to carry, the led light confirming that the product is under use, and the different devices it is compatible with. However there is one aspect that stopped this product from becoming great. The power output to charge a device is very slow. It took about two hours to completely charge one device of 2300mAh. I have similar power banks which cost about twice the price, but however they charge at double the rate.At the end of the day if you are looking for an affordable power bank that you can just grab on the go and leave plugged in your bag to charge your device, then this is absolutely great. However if you are someone such as me who lives a fast paced lifestyle and requires more power and efficiency, than you would be better off spending a bit more and getting something stronger, such as other higher end oxa products.",4,Great little gadget,1393804800,"03 03, 2014"
A1E39J0734IR7O,B00E2YI052,Sean P. Endress,"[3, 4]","Full disclosure: I received this product in exchange for a wholly honest and unbiased review. The opinions below are entirely my own.First things first: It's a good thing this product is fairly easy to use, because the manual is junk. Even if you can decipher what it's trying to say, I can't imagine it being very helpful in case of a problem. Fortunately, I can't really picture a problem with this battery. I'll get my real complaints out of the way first: One is that it didn't come with a way to charge by plugging into a wall outlet - I disassembled my cell phone charger and combined them. The other is that while it's great for when your phone dies unexpectedly, don't expect to do any intensive gaming while relying on this - it holds enough to bring your iPhone back up to full, but that's about it.For me though, that's plenty! I'm not a huge fan of the whole keyring thing (it just doesn't work for me) so I might actually just cut that off, but it really is highly convenient. I got this in the mail a few days after a trip to New York City where my phone died and left me more than a little lost! If I'd had this, I'm sure that would have been much easier. It can be carried in a purse or a coat pocket and won't slow you down a bit, since you could likely keep it and your phone in the same pocket - just plug in and keep going!One more thing - I've noticed some other reviews state that there's no light that demonstrates when the battery is charging - there is!Questions or comments?

A3V79KXIY09MOE,B00E2YI052,"Stacy ""Amazon Junkie""","[1, 1]","I am notoriously bad about charging my cell phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2, and while an older model from the Galaxy line, it still sucks a lot of juice. When I am at home I can pop in my Bluetooth headset and leave the phone on the charger. More often than not, however, I tend to not realize that my phone is nearly dead until I am ready to walk out the door to run errands. Because I have lupus, I always make sure that my phone is on me in the event something bad happens; unfortunately most of my errands are close by, so the sporadic charging of my car charger just isn&#8217;t enough.That is where the OXA 2600mAh External Battery comes in.ConstructionThe OXA External Battery (OXA for short) is a compact battery that is roughly as long as an iPod Touch, fitting in the palm of my hand comfortably. It is a bar with a keychain dangling from the end with the USB ports. When plugged in to charge (it uses the micro-USB adapter), you simply plug it in to the corresponding port and plug the standard USB end into a USB charger (either through a computer, or if you have an A/C adapter, that works well, too). While it is charging a light on the white panel with the OXA logo will turn red; from being completely dead to a full charge takes about thirty to forty-five minutes. Once it is completely charged the red light disappears, and your battery is ready-to-go!UseUsing this battery is simple: once charged, the included cable has four different adapters (referred to as &#8220;Power Connectors&#8221; by the manufacturer) that connect to the end opposite the large USB plug. To change adapters, all that you need to do is pull the old tip off and then replace it with a new one. While these are nice, they are also easily lost. This battery does not come with any type of a small pouch to carry both the wire and adapter tips, increasing the possibility of them being lost, or worse, put into the mouth of a child or pet.The adapters that I received were one of each: micro-USB, Apple (most devices), a straight jack, and one that I cannot identify (it reminds me of the plug for a Playstation Vita, but is thinner). After you have chosen the desired tip for your device and connect it to the cord, simply plug the USB tip into the top port (the &#8220;outbound&#8221;) and plug the appropriate Power Connector into the charging port on your device. If properly connected, a blue light will shine on the front white panel; once your device is at a full charge, the blue light will turn off.ConclusionBeing able to stick this adapter COMFORTABLY into the same pocket as my cell phone and go about my day has been a blessing. This unit is lightweight, snazzy-looking, and efficient. It is small enough to fit into the pockets of a pair of jeans, a briefcase, a purse, and heck, even a lunch bag! This OXA Battery will prove itself indispensable, providing a boost of power for whenever you need it. Combine this great usage with the fact there are four &#8220;Power Connectors&#8221; to support up to four different charging adapters, and suddenly you have a handy little power pack that will keep you charged on the go without the need to pack several different cables!In short, if you would like an external battery to keep on-hand for those busy days, or just as a backup while running errands/camping/to free up a socket in your home, this is the unit for you. With a keychain loop you can connect it to a bag so that you won&#8217;t lose it. The only problem that the OXA External Battery has is the lack of a bag/carrying case for the adapters and the charging cable when not in use; while the various adapters are definitely a strong selling point, you will find yourself packing a separate Ziploc bag, and that is a bit annoying when you consider the quality of the product as a whole. Either way, this is a handy thing to have on hand and I can recommend it with confidence!**Disclaimer: This unit was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review. While I do not feel that this influenced me in any capacity, I am legally obligated to disclose this fact so that you can come to your own conclusions about the merit of this analysis.**",4,Almost Perfect,1393286400,"02 25, 2014"
A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B00E2YI052,Steward Willons,"[1, 2]","The OXA 2600mAh is a nice, compact, and inexpensive battery pack. It&#8217;s job is straightforward and it performs great. Basically, you charge it via the included USB cable, and then you discharge it via whatever cable your device requires. Interestingly, the included USB cable has swappable connectors so that the other end terminates in anything from a micro USB connector to a 30-pin Apple connector. The one thing this device is missing is the new Apple Lightning connector. If you&#8217;ve got an iPhone 5s or 5c, then you&#8217;ll have to supply your own UBS-to-Lightning cable.I tried charging my iPhone and my iPod with the OXA and in both cases it did the job. It&#8217;s not recommended for tablets and indeed it didn&#8217;t give my iPad much of a charge. That&#8217;s okay. For something this small and inexpensive, it&#8217;s not too surprising.The unit is well built and I would expect it to last quite a while. It comes with a one year warranty, which is very decent compared to the normal 90-day warranty with electronics. It&#8217;s small, although I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s pocket-sized. If you carry a computer case or a purse or something, it would fit easily without adding much extra weight.Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a portable recharging solution.",5,"Small, inexpensive, works",1393286400,"02 25, 2014"
AAEVGE52KL0DJ,B00E2YI052,Tim,"[1, 1]","This is the third mini / compact USB power supply I've been asked to review (two different manufacturers) and both OXA models are by far the better of the two.I recently reviewed a nearly identical OXA product and it is so similar in form and performance that the review of the first product easily serves as the review for the second product with only a couple changes to reflect my charging tests.While this power supply seems to live up to its description, it isn't the best fit for all charging applications, and shoppers should make sure they are buying what they actually need before deciding on what to buy. Let me explain...This mini power supply, like all I have seen in its class, puts out 5 volts at 1 amp and has a 2600 mAh capacity. First let me explain my use of the word ""seems"" in the paragraph above this one. Because I don't have a proper battery tester (the ones that accurately test capacity are in the $300 range), I can only give anecdotal testimony about the power output and capacity of a battery. Because I have an extensive collection of devices and a variety of batteries for my devices, I have a pretty good idea what ""x"" amount of capacity and ""y"" amount of amps output are. My best guess is that this OXA power supply meets or possibly exceeds the claimed power output by a small measure.Now, why do I say this power supply isn't ideal for every application? The answer is that many larger and high end devices consume much more energy than what this OXA product can supply. Two examples are my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Kindle Fire. My Note 2 ships with a 2 amp charger and even that is barely enough to charge the battery if I'm using the phone as a GPS with the screen on full brightness. This OXA would certainly extend my usage time, but my phone would continue to discharge even while plugged into the charger. I did leave the phone connected to the power supply overnight with the screen off, and it did raise my battery level from 18% to 45% by morning, but my phone has a massive 9300 mAh extended battery, which explains why the power supply didn't charge it much.I plugged my iPod Touch 4th Generation into the OXA power supply and it took it from 3% to fully charged, while I was listening to the iPod over the course of a five and a half hour drive. At the end of the trip, my iPod was fully charged and the power supply still had some juice left. The reason for this is that the iPod has a much smaller battery and consumes a fraction of the energy my phone burns through.So before buying this OXA mini power supply, think about if it will do what you need it to. OXA sells a wide array of larger (and more expensive) power supplies, some of which I will be reviewing soon, and of course there are other manufacturers out there as well. I'm satisfied that this charger does what it claims, and it is (price at time of review $10.99) about half the price of competing models in the same size and power output classes. For me personally, because of my energy hungry devices, I probably would want a more powerful supply. If you're looking to charge an iPod or more energy efficient phone, then this model is definitely one you should consider.I didn't pay for my test sample, but had I bought this for $11 here on Amazon, I'd be very happy with the value I received. Most competing models in this class are selling for around $20 and may not live up to their claims (like the one I reviewed for a different manufacturer). All things considered, this little thing definitely deserves five stars.",5,Great Bang for the Buck,1393632000,"03 01, 2014"

I was able to get my iPhone fully charged once before the OXA Perfume died and had to be re-charged again. At about $10, the price is just right - in comparison, my Limeade Blast was about $40.Overall, the OXA Perfume does what it promises and for the price, it's easy to have a few lying around in case I need an emergency charge,",4,Good for the Price,1394064000,"03 06, 2014"
A4D5B7Q8A7PA6,B00E2YI052,"Vynny ""Vynrod""","[1, 1]","I've been sent various mobile phone portable battery 'banks' for review and most have done exactly what you expect; recharge your device when you're on the go. So what separates a good one from a great one?I feel form factor is important. You take pride in the look of your phone so why not the peripherals too? With Oxa's Power bank you get a nice looking slightly rounded block, with black and white coloring adorning the front and back. It's about the size of a snickers bar, a little smaller and feels chunky and weighted in your hand. Power Bank proudly etched into the plastic completes the aesthetics. Attached to one corner is a rope with a key ring on the end to allow for hooking it up to your belt or keys. Nice idea but this is a hunk of plastic that may be a little too much to hang on your phone or car keys.The second factor I feel is imperative is flexibility - do I need different USB cables for each device and if so are they included? Happy to report that Oxa went one step further by including a USB interchangeable cable and attachments for iPhone, android and presumably older phones (an extra dongle that I don't know). This is an excellent feature and means that if you jump ship from ios to android this product will still work for you. No other power cell that I've been sent does this by the way, and I've been sent around six.The USB cable itself is short but not insurmountable. Just long enough to do the job at a foot or so but not so long that power is lost merely supplying juice to your device.Charging it initially takes some time and then you are good to go. According to the manual it takes several charges and discharges to get optimal performance but I'm more than happy with the supplied amps and speed of recharge.Speaking of the manual, despite the box proudly displaying ""Designed in California, USA"", it does contain Engrish. It starts off perfectly making me think the intro was written here and the battery specs itself were written over seas. Amusing lines like ""wash not with damp rain cream"" made me smile. But fix it Oxa! Product is too good to be marred by little oversights.And it's a great product at a tiny price. Want a battery bank that looks good, works on multi platforms and delivers? This is your man.* I was provided with a sample of this item for an unbiased review.

I have liked both of them.This one is a bit smaller, more columnar shape and has a white face on the front and the other three sides are black.  While charging the front face has a blue dot that appears (it is rather good size, so there is no debate that it is charging).  When you are using it the Blue dot appears again to let you know that it is powered up and working.It took about four hours to fully charge the unit out of the box.  I then used it to charge a completely drained Flip Phone.  It took about 90 minutes to charge it completely.  It still had some battery life left so I charged my Bluetooth Zagg keyboard for my iPad air.  It charged it up in about 30 minutes (maybe the thing wasn't completely drained).I then charged another gadget and still this thing had power.I did not completely drain it.  I plugged it back in to charge and it charged fully within 75 minutes.I liked the compact size, it fits well into my briefcase.  It also has a key ring attached, but frankly I didn't think it was the sturdiest thing, so I don't think I will put a key on it and trust it to be a key ring as well as a backup battery.If you are looking for something that it light, quick to charge back up and easy to take with you then this device is excellent for the price.Enjoy!",4,Nice little device / works well,1393286400,"02 25, 2014"

A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B00E5RIDU8,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 3]","When I got my S4 Mini last month, I had to find a good case, and fast. My previous phone had a cracked screen not even 2 months after I got it, but I held out for a year before upgrading to something better. I was [literally] having nightmares now and then that my new phone would drop and get cracked before the case would arrive, so I'd be even more careful with it, never taking it out when moving around. I settled on this case from Maxboost after seeing the great overall rating on here, and when it arrived, I knew I made the right choice. This thing is insanely good, and will keep your phone very safe from accidental drops.The best thing about the case is that you can take it apart and have it set up however you want. Do you just need the rubber case for standard protection? Go ahead. Do you need a little bit more, and want a kickstand? Snap the plastic case around it and you're good to go. Are you going to be somewhere crowded or a little dangerous, where even the screen would need protection? Slide the front piece in place and your screen will be just fine. And finally, do you want to clip it to your belt or something? There's an extra part for that too!Personally, I just go with the standard rubber case, though I keep the plastic part with the kickstand on standby just in case. It's also nice to keep this part around depending on what kind of pants you're wearing if you keep it in the side or back pockets. Rubber doesn't always do very well against certain materials after all. Everything about the design is perfect- buttons are easy to press without any problems at all, and the holes for the speaker and camera are appropriately sized. They even went the extra mile with the charger and headphone jack portions, and gave them little coverings that need to be opened in order to be accessed. And as mentioned above in the images and product description, the 'lip' of the rubber case sticks out, ensuring that if you drop your phone screen-down on a flat floor, the case will take the hit instead of your screen. The kickstand works like it should too, though I don't have much use for it- I bought this just for my phone to be protected, nothing more.Heck, I think I broke the clip part right when I took it out of the box when trying to put it together. 'never did have much use for that kind of thing anyway. I was really happy to see that they included protection for the front of the screen as well. It's crazy how cheap this whole package is, when there are companies that charge three times as much for the same thing.I have no complaints. None.

Many of these companies have you spray on their secret sauce to the phone and protector (after removing your battery of course......do you see a problem with this whole idea?) while other manufactures have you make your own liquid with dish soap and then dip in your screen protector. Then you apply to you phone and quickly wipe of any extra moisture. Then if all goes right ( small chance) you have to wait a day or two while it all dries hoping that the air bubbles disappear as it dries.....once again small chance.Now compare all that to simply peeling off the backing and applying the screen protector to the phone and if you do not get it perfect the first time simply peel it off and try again.

AWH39PTZU7RJ4,B00ELCP55I,A Gonzales,"[0, 0]","I was given this product by Mpow for testing and reviewing purposes. The instruction booklet says it should take 2-3 hours to charge, but mine actually charged in less than an hour the first time I plugged it in and under two hours the second time. The charge held for about three days (I was playing music on and off at work, but the headset itself was on for about six hours each day) and I have it paired with my iPod touch and a Galaxy S3. The first thing that worried me a little about this headset was that the part that rests in your ear looked really big. I have tiny ears, but it actually fits pretty nicely with the smallest earpiece that comes in the box. The part that goes over your ear is a little big, but not big enough that the headset wouldn't stay on. That part also swivels, so you can pick which ear to wear it. It did start getting a little sore after a few hours of wearing it, but again, that might be because my ear is a little bit too small for the entire thing. It was also a bit frustrating to have to keep my hair either pulled back or wear it over my ears because it's too long and too thick to tuck it behind my ear while the earpiece is on, since the part tucked behind your ear is bigger here than on most headsets. The sound quality of the headset is pretty good! The last few headsets I had would only play one audio channel when connected to my iPod if it would connect to my iPod at all, so I was glad to find that was not the case here. The audio is nice and clear and plays both channels. The controls also work with my iPod, and it's easy to get used to reaching up behind your ear for the controls. My only real problem with this headset was that if I walked away from my phone while carrying my iPod, the headset would go a little nuts and would start beeping to warn me that I was out of range. I didn't think it would affect the music on the iPod, but it started skipping a little and trying to pair up with my phone again. I've been working around that by turning the bluetooth on my phone off when I have to walk away from it and turning it back on when I come back to my desk, and that seems to work, so it's not a huge hassle, but it's something to be aware of. Overall, this headset is definitely worth the price, and I love that I can pair it with two things at once.",4,Great headset!,1402185600,"06 08, 2014"
A1W415JP5WEAJK,B00ELCP55I,Alex S,"[0, 0]","I am not certain why there are two separate products listed under this Amazon setting, but I am reviewing the over-ear headset headphone.First of all, it connected easily and seamlessly with my iPhone. I powered it on (as per the instructions) and my iPhone recognized it.Second - I have very small ears. So I was particularly grateful that it had three different sized plugs that allowed me to choose the small one. Even more, it turns easily and that makes it easy to use on either ear. Important because I have a slight loss of hearing in one of my ears.The sound from the music on my iPhone was clear and easily controlled by the volume buttons. Additionally, the multipurpose button - off/on, accept or reject call is easy to locate next to where the plug goes into the ear.I wear glasses, and as long as I put the headphone on first and slipped my glasses over it, everything worked smoothly for me.It has been raining outdoors, so I wasn't able to test it fully for distance, but it worked well within the confines of my home (1200 sq ft) without losing signal. While the talk / music time is listed as 5 hours, that is probably a max amount of time. In reality, 3-5 hours is more accurate. Still, I use a lot more standby time than I do talk time, so I found it to be well within my acceptable limits.While I didn't use it significantly for phone calls, I did test it and was pleased with the sound on both ends of the call, both incoming and reception from the microphone picking up voice on the home phone I used.All in all, a very nice little headphone, easy to use with well-written instructions.

A1E74OKDCHYTNA,B00ELCP55I,Amazon,"[0, 0]","Overall this is a great bluetooth headset, there are only a few flaws of which make it hard for me to use. The biggest is that it doesn't quite fit on my ear properly.Pros:The sound is good on the bluetooth headset as I can hear it quite well when I am driving along the road. It flawlessly pairs with my iPhone and android devices without taking too long. The headset is very comfortable and doesn't hurt after long usage. There are audible signals when it is connected or when the battery is low. The device actually speaks out and tells you the status. It is nice and loud and it works great with apps such as google maps and waze. I use it to listen to my directions when I am driving. The headset is great that it can be put on either ear without much trouble. The noise cancellation somewhat works, but not as well as bose quality. The headphone is light so that is isn't going to make your ear tired when wearing it for long periods of time. I like how this headset does not have a microphone sticking out, so it is very concealed when wearing it. The microphone provides very clear quality even though it is located far away from the vocal point. The battery life is great, I have used it for quite a while not without having to charge it.I have much more praise for this item, but I will move onto the negatives.Cons:This headset is not for people with small ears like me. It doesn't fit quite well as it somewhat hangs loosely on my ear due to the fact that it the shape of it is for larger ears. There is a gap between my ear and the headphone when I am wearing it. I did find a workaround to put it on my ear though, you have to put it in at an angle and rotate the earpiece so that it is a a 135 degree angle instead of the 90 that it is at. I found that after setting it up and adding it to my ear that way that it DOES NOT fall off, but is a pain to put on. I did notice that sometimes when the volume on my phone was at max, the headset would make PSSSSSH sounds instead of outputting any sound, this can easily be fixed by adjusting the volume on your phone.Overall, even though the fit isn't good, the headphone is pretty good for the price, I would recommend it over other headphones that I have used due to the fact that it is clear and it is concealed when it is on my ear even though once again, it doesn't fit properly.I will have more to add once I use it more.",4,Not for small ears!,1402704000,"06 14, 2014"

During my work day I have a lot of phone calls that I have to deal with, but I also like to listen to podcasts and audiobooks.  I have always used a headset for this but when I switched to a phone with wireless charging (Nexus 5) I wanted to leave it sitting on the charger on my desk.  This headset was the perfect fit for what I needed.  First, it is subtle.  There is not a giant brick strapped to the side of your head.  It is not like I wear this thing in public, but I just couldn't buy something that didn't have that discrete look.  Setup was simple, which you would expect with a new headset.  I tested it on my wife's iPhone as well and it worked easily with both of our phones.  Phone calls were crisp and clear and people on the other side don't repeat &#34;what... what?&#34; when I talk to them so I think the pass through sound is good.  The best part of the headset was the ability to stream audio from your phone because it has A2DP.If there was one thing I would change on this unit it would be to have it come with longer rubber ear pieces.  I am used to wearing ear buds that go in ear and I would like to have that option with this headset as well.  The rubber ear piece that comes with this headset sits in the outer part of your ear and is comfortable, but it does not go into the ear canal.  If it went into the ear canal I could wear it cycling as it would block out wind noise.So if you are looking for a subtle quality device look no further, the Mpow has got you covered.",4,Nice device for the price.,1404086400,"06 30, 2014"

The micro USB cable is black, almost flat, and well made, with clips at on the micro USB connector for keeping the connection sturdy. I like that this uses the micro USB interface, as it is the most common interface used by Android devices, and is easily replaceable. The earhooks are literally eartips of different size for the best fit. The carrying case is black, with a red MPow logo, and has red stitching at the top to seal the retractable straps. This was a very nice touch, as it keeps the device sealed when it isn&#8217;t opened.

This far exceeds the expectations in the specifications, which is a very surprising result.  The sound quality was clear, without any distortions, but I can&#8217;t honestly rate base, as this only fits one ear. The buttons were very fluid and capable of performing tasks without sticking. The device fit well around my ear but it was difficult to properly fit the smallest silicon eartip into my ear. This was expected though, as I have very small ear canals. After the 14 hour period, the device didn&#8217;t make my ear sore, unlike similar products I have used before, which is very refreshing. The only test with unsatisfactory results was the range, as it tested to only have a 10-12 foot range, instead of the rated 33 feet. My cell phone has connected to other Bluetooth products with a range of over 50 feet, so I am unsure why this device would have these results. Overall, beside this one issue, I am very satisfied by the usage, functionality, and design of the product.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThe product fit well, is well crafted, and tested well.

A lot had poor performance, extremely uncomfortable or both.I travel a lot and sometimes it&#8217;s just cumbersome having to hold the phone when talking and trying to multitask.  So I gave the FreeGO a try and I&#8217;m glad I did.*Performance/Build Quality*When first looking at the unit; I was worried it was going to be too heavy with the size but I was pleasantly surprised when picking it up.  It&#8217;s a lot lighter than I expected.  Even though it was light weight it didn&#8217;t feel cheap in the slightly.  Nothing flexed, or creaked to the point where I was worried about it falling apart.The unit itself has a two toned looked to it.  A shiny glossy part and matte soft rubber part.  The soft rubber part is what actually is in contact with your ear.  This makes it extremely comfortable to wear.  So comfortable that I&#8217;d forget I had it on to be honest.  The silicone ear tip that creates a &#8220;seal&#8221; for sound doesn&#8217;t really create a seal as the tip is oddly &#8220;flat&#8221; shaped.  It&#8217;s not like the tips on earphones/earbuds where you would jam them in your ear canal.  It simply hovers over the opening.  This worried me at first that calls or sounds would be difficult to hear.  Once again it surprised me.  Calls still came in crystal clear, music sounded good and never missed a notification sound.  I think the odd shape and not shoving them in the ear canal is what makes the headset so comfortable.Can be used on either ear.  The earpiece has a 180 Degree Flip-boom arm for both left or right ear.  Which is really convenient depending which ear you want to use it on.The unit has 3 buttons: Volume up, volume down and answer call.  All were easy to access when worn and always responsive.  Pairing it to my phone or tablet was a cinch and took no longer than 2 minutes for initial pairing and subsequent pairings took seconds.Sound quality was just amazing.  Never did I feel like it wasn&#8217;t clear.  The mic also performed superbly.  The person on the line never had a problem hearing me or asked me to speak louder.  What else can you ask for?Last; it stayed in place.  I&#8217;m sure everyone had that headset that was just impossible to keep in place and you ended adjusting it all the time.  Not this one; I had it on the ENTIRE day and not once did I have to adjust it.*Packaging*It comes in a simple box.  Has 3 different ear tips, a small faux leather pouch and a micro usb cable (flat cable which is a nice touch).  The micro usb cable is of decent quality which is a plus in my book.  It did not come with a wall plug though.  So either use your phones or plug it into your computer to charge it.*Conclusion*It&#8217;s a no brainer for me if you&#8217;re looking for a great value Bluetooth headset.  Good performance, good price and comfortable.  I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone.",5,Great Bang for Buck Bluetooth Headset!,1402012800,"06 06, 2014"
A36K2N527TXXJN,B00ELCP55I,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"[1, 1]","This is a very ergonomically and elegantly made little headset. I am not a big fan of bluetooth headsets in general, but if there is one that I would continuously use and recommend to anyone then it would be this small Mpow one.The headset synced very easily with my iPhone 4S. The connection was very stable and without any hitches for the duration of use. The headset turns on and off with a single press of the button.The sound quality was as clear as you could possibly expect from a Bluetooth headset. I was able to hear the person I was speaking with very clearly and with only the most minute of audio distortions. Unfortunately, my interlocutors did not seem to have as clear of a connection as I did. I was also mostly testing this headset in places without much background noise. The headset has some noise cancelling features, but I would not rely on them too much.My favorite features of this headset are its design and ergonomics. The headset is really small, soft and light, and it fits around your your ear very comfortably. The in-ear piece is also very soft and comfortable. The in-ear piece can be rotated 180 degrees, so that it can fit in either left or right ear. I had worn this headset for about half an hour at a time, and had hardly noticed that it was there. If you put a premium on physical comfort then this headset is as good as they come.I really liked this headset, but I am still not going to toss away my &#34;regular&#34; iPhone headphones for phone calling.",4,Well Designed and Comfortable,1389916800,"01 17, 2014"

Performance is fine, though you shouldn't expect any spectacular sound or anything, it does get the job done and reliably so.  I'm coming off 2+ years of being utterly abused by Motorola Elite Silver headsets, and in that context, this unit is a dream.  A couple of nitpicks - the battery life is a little disappointing and for an over the ear design the unit seems rather bulky and too conspicuous.  That is the one area which the Moto did better - it wasn't so noticeable.  Back to the battery.  I listen to podcasts almost all day while working, exercising, just about anytime I'm not spending time with my family.  And it seems all too often that I hear the ""Low battery"" warning.  The upshot is that charging seems very quick.  I'd much rather buy another of these as a backup while the other charges than spend double or triple on a headset from some of the better known manufacturers out there.  Nice little unit at a great price!UPDATE 2014/06/11 - About 3.5 months in and the battery is now down to 1 hour of operation before shutting itself off.  This changes the cost/benefit analysis quite a bit.  The sudden decline seems like it happened over a 3 to 4 week period too.  I'm not sure if I got a bum unit or if the source for the battery is just really that bad.  Either way don't expect this to be your daily ear piece for very long.",2,Not bad,1397433600,"04 14, 2014"

Also allows for wearing on either ear.- Different sized tips supplied. I actually didn't like the shape of the tips so I used a spare from an earphone and that fit perfectly.- Easy to sync, Bluetooth works well.- Sound is good.Comes with carrying bag and extra tips. The device is pretty lightweight and once you have it on you forget about it after a while.

Well think again, after a few days of usage I couldn't find much fault in this Freego device. It pairs easily, stays paired, fits well in the ear with no discomfortand it just works! I took calls and even made calls handsfree with this. I even asked the person on the other end how it sounded. I got good quality reviews from those I spoke with, even when I was driving. So the noise cancelation works pretty good. I am a Jawbone Icon owner, and I can say this does rival it. Now you can't add apps or change the voice or anything like that you can on some of the Jawbone products, but is that really worth another $70? I was very happy with the performance of this Freego and I am giving it 5 stars. I didn't find any where in the manual where it said it would make calls, but holding the button down for like 2 seconds and releasing it triggers Siri on my iphone 5S, and then I can just speak dial name mobile and it called my contacts with no issue.

AJW53ACXUCJ0M,B00ELCP55I,"mark ""Professional Appreciator""","[19, 22]","UPDATE: I now have 3 Mpow bluetooth headsets.  2 of the ""FreeGo"" behind-the-ear headsets, and now I just received the ""Foldable"" stereo headset.  The stereo headset for the price is amazing.  Very nice design, great battery, controls, and good to great sound.  I have a number of stereo bluetooths (Motorola SF600, Plantronics Backbeat 903+, Jabra BT3030) and soundwise this Mpow Foldable is better than all three of the others I have.  And in keeping with Mpow's model, it's also 1/3-1/2 the price!  The rest of the review below is for the FreeGo earpiece model.  Amazon apparently lists both under the same product when it comes to reviews.First and foremost; I LOVE THIS HEADSET!!!Okay, now that that's out of the way I'll explain:I'm almost a collector of sorts when it comes to bluetooth headsets.  I currently own over 40 headsets... really!  While no headset is perfect, and personal preference dictates that no one headset reigns supreme, the Mpow FreeGo headset is about as good as it gets.  I love this headset!The Mpow FreeGo is BETTER than both the Jabra Stone (I & II) and the Motorola Sliver Elite.  Both of those headsets will cost you between $99 and $129 depending on a few factors.  I currently own 4 Jabras and 4 Motorolas - so finding a $29 headset with the same super low-key form factor (behind the ear w/no face boom) made me instantly interested in the Mpow device.So, is the much cheaper Mpow as good as the super expensive Jabra and Motorola?  The answer is simply yes and yes!  The FreeGo overall is better - and in some ways far better - than both the Jabra and Motorola.  After using the FreeGo for about 3 days I was so pleased, I immediately bought another.  I now have two Mpow FreeGo headsets and I'm using them as my daily go-to devices.Speaking from experience you simply won't find a better value when it comes to 1) price, 2) features and 3) form factor.  You may find a device that has better noise cancellation, or one that has longer battery life, but not at this price and with this behind the ear style.Pros:- Form Factor (behind-the-ear nearly invisible design)- Excellent sound quality for music and audio streaming- Good build quality (as good as Motorola and Jabra IMO)- Decent to good battery life (approx 5+ hours of streaming verified)- Fully functional Play/Pause, Fast Forward/Rewind A2DP control!!!- Distance is good (some other reviewers say otherwise - but 30 ft. for me)- Price!!! Priced like a bargain basement bluetooth - but performs with the best!Cons:- Fit (a little bigger than Motorola - which may be too large for some ears)- Mic and noise cancellation on par with Motorola - which is so-so to good - depending on background noise.- The Fast Forward/Rewind controls are backwards (Volume Up = Rewind instead of the reverse).Note: This headset blows the Jabra Stone I & II away in EVERY category - and it's on par with the Motorola Sliver Elite with sound and mic quality, but way better with price and features.  The only thing it lacks compared to the competition is a portable charging dock - which all things considered is no big deal.",5,"Great headset!

A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B00ELCP55I,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[0, 0]","Of all of the headsets that I have tested the review sample of this one stands out for a number of reasons. Foremost is the clarity on both ends of a call. Even when I use this outside with a breeze in the background the receiving end of the calls have no problems with ambient noise.The second reason why I love this is comfort. I have a low tolerance for in-ear devices, but this one does not bother me at all. No irritation, even after hours of using it. Plus, I have used it for eight hours straight on a single battery charge, with most of the time on the phone. That is a major convenience for me. The specs claim ten hours, and I have no reason to doubt that number because call quality after eight hours was superb. Other headsets that I have tested start to degrade after six hours and become successively muddled after that point.For folks who use two phones this has features than the older headsets lack. For one thing you can pair and connect two phones to it simultaneously.Bottom line: this is a full featured headset what is comfortable, has exceptionally clear sound and is a true workhorse. In addition to all that, although it performs like the high end set it is, it's priced like an entry level set, so it's also a value.",5,Advanced features and comfortable,1399766400,"05 11, 2014"

However, I started to miss the convenience of hands-free talking, so I recently started using this Mpow headphone. I am really pleased with how well it works! The first time I used it, I switched to the headset during the middle of a call, and I couldn't believe that the other person didn't even notice. I kept asking them if they could hear me alright, and they said yes and didn't understand why I kept asking. They were also surprised to learn that I was on a Bluetooth headset (and that was while driving in a car too!)I thought people would have trouble hearing me because the unit wraps back around your ear and it looks like the microphone is towards the back, but it turns out people hear me very well.The headset can be easily switched from right ear to left ear by simply twisting the ear-bud part. It has volume buttons and the answer/hangup button (which is also the power button, and takes some getting used to for pressing it while wearing them).The battery life has been adequate (not as good as the flip-style Bluetooths that turn off every time you hang up). But the best thing about it for me is that it is barely noticeable. Since the bulk of it is hidden behind your ear, most people will not even see  that you have it in.It can be used to listen to music or other audio through your phone or other Bluetooth device. The only concern I have is that due to its position behind your ear, if you sweat at all, it gets wet right away. This hasn't been a problem for me yet because I just don't use it when I am sweating, but it could potentially be a problem.Overall, I definitely recommend it.

Thankfully, Mpow contacted me in regards to sending me a free review sample of this headset. I jumped on the opportunity.The headset is well made and I don't really have any fear stuffing it into my pocket. One nice feature is the earpiece swivels, meaning you can use it in either ear.What I liked about the Wave is that it wasn't really IN my ear, it sat on my ear and there was little to no pressure in my ear. I hate that, and it's one of the biggest reasons I use over the ear headphones. The FreeGo sits in my ear a bit more than the Wave did, but it doesn't really seem to create any pressure, meaning I can wear it for extended periods of time.There are 3 headphone tips included, small, medium and large. They are OK in the area of comfort, and I use the smallest in my ear.Pairing the headset is simple. Turn the power on by holding the multifunction (has a phone symbol on it). Keep it pressed in until the light flashes red and green. Enable BT on your phone and it should pick it up. Put the headset in your ear and you are good to go.Audio quality, on both ends, is quite good. The 15 or so people I've spoken to while wearing this headset tell me they don't really hear a difference between this and my old Wave, which is really good.Overall, the headset works well, does what you expect and is affordably priced.High recommended.",5,Works well,1400284800,"05 17, 2014"

The headset can be paired with a cell phone, or other Bluetooth enabled device, such as a laptop or tablet.  The headset has a swiveling center stem, which permits it to be worn on either ear.The headset comes with three silicone inserts of different sizes.  The inserts are designed to rest just outside the aural canal, rather than being inserted inside.  While not the most comfortable thing to have in your ear, wearing the FreeGo is not that bad, and you do kind of get used to it after a while.  Your results may vary, but I don't experience a great deal of irritation, even when worn for a long period of time.  Since the insert doesn't seal in the ear, you can still hear a lot of the ambient sound, so you may need to adjust the volume accordingly.A sample was provided for evaluation, and initially I wasn't that pleased with the location of the ""multifunction button"", which among other things, is used to connect to an incoming call.  The button is located in the center of the earpiece, right over the aural canal, and I have to feel around a bit to find it.  I have an aversion to pressing directly into my ear, and would like it better if the multifunction button was located on the section that rests on the top of the ear, say below where the volume controls are.Other than the multifunction button, I don't have any major issues with the FreeGo.  The earpiece is pretty light, and is well supported by the ear, without causing pain.  If some discomfort does occur, you can always try switching ears.  Range seems to be slightly better than the standard 30' limit.While mainly intended for use will a cell phone, the FreeGo can also be paired with a laptop, tablet, or other Bluetooth enabled device.  While not the same as true stereo, music remains very listenable.The ideal situation would be to try the headset on before you buy, but that may not be possible, so if you do get one, hopefully it works well for you.  The unit comes with a micro-USB cord for recharging, and a rather nice carrying case.",5,"comfortable bluetooth headset, that can be worn on either ear...",1400112000,"05 15, 2014"

Now you can enjoy Netfix videos on your lunch hour.T-Mobile is selling the LG F3 for the amazing price of $49 at T-Mobile's expanding network of neighborhood MetroPcs stores and at the MetroPcs website.Prepaid customers at MetroPcs get an extra 20% discount on monthly service compared with T-Mobile's regular prepaid monthly fee.  MetroPcs customers enjoy unlimited use of the T-Mobile network for just $40 a month including all taxes and fees.The T-Mobile LG F3 delivers consistently fast data speeds in 70% of America's largest cities because it connects to both T-Mobile's new 4G LTE network and also to their very fast HSPA+ 3G network.NOTE: The T-Mobile coverage map lets you enter your zip code and zoom in to see the quality of the 4G coverage on your block.Outside of major cities, the LG F3 will get bumped down to T-Mobile's 2G Edge network. The T-Mobile 2G network is often faster than the Sprint 3G network my old phone used, and it is fast enough for email, news and streaming Pandora Radio.The F3 has an sharp four inch screen in a compact body weighing just four ounces, similar in size to the Apple iPhone 5. The dual core processor is fast enough for most apps, but not for some 3D action games.Although the LG F3 is one of the smallest 4G LTE phones available, it has a massive battery that lasts 50% longer than the average smartphone. It is possible to go 24 hours on a charge unless you are using GPS or streaming videos.If you are streaming videos over 4g LTE or navigating with GPS, you can consume 25% of your battery charge in just an hour.The front speaker sounds good indoors but is a bit too quiet for a noisy environment. Turning on noise cancellation helps. The rear speaker works well as a speakerphone but is only adequate for music. With good ear buds, music sounds great.The camera takes good photos in bright sunlight, but is mediocre in dim light and indoors. Videos are okay, but not great.WEAKNESS: Only a TINY 1.2gb of internal memory is available after you update the pre-installed apps such as Google Maps.To free  internal memory: for each app you do not use, go into ""settings"", to ""apps"", select ""all apps"" and look for apps using more than 1mb of memory that you never use. Uninstall the updates, unselect notifications and then delete or disable the app.Apps most people do NOT use include Google+, Google Books, Google Magazines, Google Movies, Google Music and the Chrome browser app. Removing the updates and disabling those apps frees 200 megs of memory.Install a 16gb or 32gb sd card to hold your music and photos. Some large apps, such as Netflix, can be moved to the SD card.An oval LED light around the home button changes from red to green when the F3 is fully charged. The light blinks when you have an unread text or email.CASES: Most LG F3 cases on Amazon are for the Sprint/Virgin 720 version and do NOT fit the T-Mobile/MetroPCS MS659 version.Search Amazon for ""case MS659"" or visit a T-Mobile or MetroPCS store to get a case guaranteed to fit.

The new LG F3 was an outstanding upgrade with improvements across the board. Very easy to switch the T-Mobile number to the new phone. I took it to the store, because the F3 needed a smaller sim card than the old phone had. Took 3 minutes and zero dollars.The screen is 4.0 inches, the same size of an iPhone. Perfect for a pants pocket. The 800x480 resolution is crisp and very readable in all conditions except very bright direct sunlight.The dual core 1.2Ghz process is up to all but the most demanding tasks. Texting, emailing, web surfing, and camera tasks are easily handled by the brain in this unit. So far, my daughter has had no complaints about games running poorly. I expect unless you are playing the latest 3D games, this phone is more than up to any gaming task.4G LTE with T-Mobile is much faster than 4G. Works perfectly in wi-fi mode as well.The dual cameras are fine, and similar in quality to all but the highest end camera phones, such as the latest iPhone, Galaxy S-class, or Nexus phone. The out-facing camera is a respectable 5MP. The F3 has image stabilization, which is a nice feature. Also has a flash, burst mode, and auto focus. Also records 1080p HD video.GPS is very accurate and quick. Navigation works as one expects.1GB of RAM and 4GB of ROM are adequate, and equal or better than many phones in this price range.The 2,460 mAh battery easily lasts all day, and spares are inexpensive.The phone will soon be receiving the Kitkat (Android 4.4) upgrade, with no rooting required, which will put this model in elite standing among smartphones. Other models that came out shortly before this one are being left out of the upgrade path to Kitkat.I threw in a 32BG microsd card from Amazon, and it was ready for music, photos, and videos galore.There are oodles of very nice cases on Amazon at excellent prices. Got the daughter a pink/white polka dot case that fits perfectly, isn't too bulky, yet provides amazing protection, and looks very nice.For about 175 bones, this phone is a true winner.

AM3R8PW5WQ7UB,B00ET9XQQ8,James,"[23, 25]","My most recent T-Mobile devices have been an SIII and the LG L9.  With the exception of LTE the SIII was superior in every way so this review will focus on the comparing the F3 to the L9.  I got mine on here on Amazon for $199 but I've seen the price since come down to $188 on two occasions.  The F3 has a slightly lower resolution but the smaller screen makes up for this.  The processor is faster at 1.2GHz vs 1.0GHz and is noticeable.  It won't blow your doors off but day to day you'll notice the slight lag between similar tasks get smaller.  Available space is the same but thats not saying much as I ran into space problems with the L9 and was never able to get it rooted (too difficult).  I've read some people have gotten the F3 rooted via motochopper which makes me optimistic.  I will try this method and update when complete.  As for the battery, there's a lot of talk about the battery size vs the screen size and how it should result in better life.  To be honest, I'm only seeing a couple more hours of additional use but I have a heavy user with lots of screen time and data use (unlimited).  HSDPA is very power efficient versus LTE and that's becoming apparent with the F3.  The main drawback of the L9 was the inclusion of a 21Mbps radio vs the 42Mbps the SIII had.  To me 42Mbps felt as fast as Verizon LTE.  I would frequently see 10-15Mbps in the Chicagoland area which is more than enough to be usable and I would have been happy to keep the SIII.  Due to marketing necessities T-Mobile had to move to LTE.  The day T-Mobile began reframing in Chicago I saw my HSDPA speeds drastically drop and my latency skyrocket epically in the Loop.  I've been told these are not related but I doubt it and was very unhappy with my service.  The move onto LTE via the F3 has been refreshing and I now have good data service again at my office.  For me this device is a place holder until the Nexus 5 comes out or I pull the trigger on LG G2 or the Sony Z1 (I need a big battery but don't want a phablet).  These mid range devices like the F3 and L9 save money but they make a lot of sacrifices.  For example, the F3 still doesn't have an auto screen dimmer like every other premium device out there.  With the inclusion of LTE, notification light, larger battery and more comfortable size there is no reason to consider the L9 over the F3.  I would recommend going with a more premium device over the F3 but if funds or something else is holding you back the F3 is a good compromise.Update, 9/30/2013.  Rooting via motochopper method was easy and done in less than five minutes.  The removal of Lookout probably helped the most.  If you search for ""root LG F3"" the results should come up on the first page and are dated 8/18/13.Update 10/7/2013.  The GPS at times seems to get confused causing the pointer arrow (within Google maps) to change directions or even report me being on the wrong street.  This usually happens when I'm driving slowly or stopped and seems to go away when I start moving again.  I haven't had this happen on my other devices and LGs track record of updating leads me to believe this won't get corrected.Update 10/30/2013.  The tiny amount of storage space on this phone is killing me.  I find myself clearing out the cache on Chrome, Currents, ect, a couple times a week.  Even 4Gigs would have been better.Update 11/18/2013.  The ""email"" app on this phone which is used to sync all non gmail accounts seems to only work over WIFI.  GPS problems persist.  I did start moving my apps to the SD card which has marginally helped with the storage issues.Update 12/13/2013.  2 updates have come out in the past week.  These are the first since owning the phone.  Neither broke the root but it also doesn't seem like they did anything as I'm still on 4.1....Update 12/22/2013.  1 more update since the last but I still don't see any decernable differences.  This will be my last update as I purchased a Moto X.  Comparatively the Moto X has much worse battery life but a nicer screen, faster processor and far more storage.  I guess I didn't realize how good the battery life was on the LG F3.  Don't underestimate it.",3,Not premium but a good compromise,1379980800,"09 24, 2013"
ABVYGB2TKBO8F,B00ET9XQQ8,"J. Donaldson ""Cal-diver""","[4, 4]","UPDATE Nov 10, 2013We now have three of these and have put aside our feature phones and iPod Touch devices. We've converted fully over to the LG F3. During my test phase I had few opportunities to use the LG's phone features. We now have all made and received calls and are quite pleased with the clarity of the phone. I've been using a Samsung Convoy 2 feature phone for a couple of years. This LG is much clearer and easier to understand the voice conversation than the Samsung was.UPDATE Nov 5,2013I've now had the LG F3 for a couple of weeks. The best way I can describe how pleased I am with it is to say that two days ago I ordered two more for use by my wife and son.The limited internal memory is a concern but I've loaded most of the apps I really need and I still have over 300MB left. A few apps can be moved to the SD card. If you tend to load a lot of apps this phone will restrict you. You may want to look elsewhere. I have 28 apps loaded and may have room for about 10 more. I've been able to move just a few of the apps to the SD card but most don't allow that. I have 132 apps on my iPod Touch, of which I could easily delete about 1/2 of them and not miss them. So in my case I guess I'd like to have about 60 apps but will be restricted to something like 40. Of course apps are all different sizes so your mileage may vary. If only LG had doubled the internal memory this would be a perfect smartphone in this price range.Original Review follows...Okay I've only had the LG F3 for 24 hours but I'm quite pleased with it.Here's a brief overview with a longer review to follow.Pros:- A user replaceable battery. My #1 feature for a smartphone. I really don't want a phone without this feature.- A microSD card slot. I have a 32GB card installed.- At $199 it is a lot of smartphone for the money.- The screen resolution is quite good. I think the 4"" display (small size for today's smartphones) helps. 233 PPI isn't the lowest in this size display, and it certainly isn't the highest. I think it looks sharp and clear.- At 4 ounces it is comfortably light- The plastic back doesn't feel cheap to me as many reviews suggested. In fact I like the texture that makes it less likely to drop because you can get a decent grip on it.- The dark blue, almost black, back and side edge along with the silver strip on the sides and bottom look elegant to me. I just don't understand the comments about this phone not looking nice from most reviewers.- Loaded with Android 4.1.2 it has good operating system features such as notifications, Widgets, and a huge array of apps available from the store, many if not most are free. I do wonder how it will hold up over time, but I'm pretty easy on my phone.- A decent set of apps pre-installed including Maps, photo and video, alarm clock, Chrome, Memo, Messaging, Music, etc.- The LG F3 is responsive, and the touch screen has the right amount of sensitivity.- This model, sold on Amazon, works perfectly on T-Mobile including their LTE service.- GPS, WiFi, tethering, and Bluetooth. I don't need more than that.Cons:- As others have said the 1.27GB available internally is just sad. I have been able to move two apps to the SD card and I still have over 500MB of storage left after loading 10 apps. This might be the one thing that could drive me to get a different phone. We'll see if we run out of memory after loading those we normally want. There are several apps that came loaded on the phone that I could delete to make space.- The camera works and you can get good daytime photos from it, but it's nothing to write home about. Good enough for Facebook sharing I'd say.- The max volume is about 15% too low out of the speakerphone, and also from my Bluetooth connected speaker.- The WiFi isn't dual band so I can't use it on my faster 5MHz band at home.Personal preferences:- I don't like having the power button on the side. It seems more natural to me on the top.- The start button is physical. I prefer a capacitive touch button. But perhaps the physical button is the right thing for this phone because that is how you wake the phone. If it was capacitive touch it might turn on in my pocket.- I don't like having the earphone socket on the top. I prefer it on the bottom. That way if I have the phone plugged into a USB cable for any reason then both cables come out of the same place.- I'm not a big game player. If you can find games that will install on the SD card you might then be faced with insufficient computing power. I'd say this phone isn't the one to buy if you like CPU demanding games. I'm more of a Minesweeper, Freecell, Bejeweled, kind of player which this phone is fine for.In my opinion spending three times the money to get a Galaxy 4 or iPhone 5S won't bring three times the features, functions, or usability. You might want a different phone if you want a better camera, or if you need more space for apps.Longer Review:My reference for evaluating this phone is mostly from several years of using iPod Touch devices. An iPod Touch is almost an iPhone without the phone. My iPod Touch 5th gen with a 4"" screen cost me $399, double the cost of the LG F3. And to tell you the truth I really can't see double the value in the Apple product. Furthermore I can't replace the battery in the iPod Touch, and the lack of user customization of Apple products drives me crazy. The new iOS 7 design was too much for me. Time to move on.I've never owned a smartphone until recently because I simply don't want to pay the high prices for a data plan. But I discovered some positive changes by T-Mobile recently that made me realize I don't have to pay high prices to get data plans.This is a T-Mobile phone so I thought it appropriate to include some T-Mobile information as part of my review.T-Mobile may not have the best coverage but they are doing some things that will pull more customers their way. First they have an agreement with AT&T; (long story) to use AT&T; towers for voice only roaming at no charge to T-Mobile customers. This means we can count on decent voice service from T-Mobile. Second T-Mobile has been building out its LTE data service and it pretty much fully covers our small city of Redding CA. Third T-Mobile no longer has contracts on any of their plans. Very Cool! No more 2 year commitments. To top it off T-Mobile has some interesting plans.We currently pay $100 a month for service on three feature phones, two of which have 250 text plans. We make few calls, use few texts, and don't use any data. I'm tired of paying $100 a month for so little use. Switching to T-Mobile and smartphones (virtual keyboard instead of just a number pad) will allow us to use text more often, and most of all we'll have internet access.T-Mobile has an ""unlimited"" family plan for $90/mo for three lines that will give each of the three of us unlimited talk and text. After the first 500MB of data each is used up the system will drop us from the LTE/4G/3G data down to 2G. But with this plan we will be paying a few dollars less a month than we are with Verizon, and we'll have data access! Very Cool!So the only real questions are which phone to buy, and will T-Mobile's coverage be good enough. To that end I started out buying a Nokia Lumia 521 which I liked but found the Windows Phone 8 lacking both in terms of the OS features and available apps. I then switched to an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket which was a lot of phone but it won't work (without jail breaking) on the T-Mobile LTE service, and the phone sucked battery power. So here I am on the LG F3.It's gonna kill me to pay Verizon termination charges to get out of the contracts there. And I'll end up spending $600 on three of these LG Optimus F3 phones perhaps. But I don't mind one time charges so much. It is those high month to month charges that really kill me.If I were to go with Verizon and get three iPhone 5C phones my monthly bill would be $200 vs $90 on this T-Mobile plan. I might have better service but for $110 a month difference I'll put up with waiting a little while until I'm in a better service area.T-Mobile also lets me use my home WiFi to make calls while at home so I don't have to worry about how close to a T-Mobile tower we are. Also T-Mobile doesn't charge for tethering.This phone has enough space for apps so I can have news, weather, stocks, podcasts, maps, photos, videos, watch movies, play simple games, skype video, email, message, Facebook, browse the internet, shop with apps such as Amazon or Best Buy, and use the calendar. It is quite enough for me.",5,"Very nice, especially considering the price.",1382745600,"10 26, 2013"

I used this phone for almost a month and was impressed with the smooth functioning of the touch screen and ease of adding apps, ect. Where this phone lost 2 stars for me, and what eventually made it a deal breaker and made me return it was mainly two things. Tracfone has made its reputation on the ease with which you can keep track of the minutes and service days you use, which is very important to me. With this new system, they have not yet ironed out the app that allows you to do this from the phone screen, which negates the main reason I carry a tracfone. It seemed like I was losing some min and txt time every few days and I have no  idea how or why, (I had the data mode disabled and only made calls using google voice while on wifi, so I don't know how this was possible.Second, the wifi connection, as reported by others, is very weak and barely reaches 15-18 ft from our wireless router in our small, (1400 sq ft), home. I think  once these type of smartphones have been on the tracfone brand for a while longer and these issues are ironed out, we may try another one sometime down the line. Meanwhile, the LG840G does more than I need a cell phone to do, (watch video/read books/listen to music/basic web surfing/take basic video/pictures...and oh yes, make an occasional phone call).",3,"A very nice phone, especially for Tracfone",1390780800,"01 27, 2014"
A2LAS014NSRW72,B00FM7R1WG,Amy Henry,"[4, 4]","This ZTE looks just like a fancy smartphone and offers the same features, but is SO much cheaper. I bought it and as soon as I charged it I was able to switch my existing tracfone phone number to this one. (See below for important catch).  I had to spend some time getting acquainted with all the features, and was able to set up my email accounts easily without all that log in data that usually takes some knowledge (of which I have none).  Lots of regular features, plus Bluetooth.  Data is easy, but reading from the net is small and awkward.It can be used in portrait and landscape position, just be turning the phone.  Easy to set alarms and also a bedtime clock that is faint but helpful at night.  Standard camera and video.Here's the big issue to watch out for:  when I transferred my phone number (which was super easy) it deleted the minutes I had left on my tracfone.  I thought both would transfer. TF was then a royal pain in the behind at this point, saying I had no minutes left, and my old phone became &#34;unregistered&#34; when I sent the new number over so I lost almost 200 minutes.  I was ticked and TF says there was no way to determine how many minutes were lost. (Really? Their computers can't tell? I didn't believe them)SO, my advice is to have your old phone (if you are using one in the first place) and CALL tracfone and have them activate manually.  Make them confirm your minutes and data left before you do anything.  Have both phones in hand when you call.Another warning: when you set up email, it transfers all your email contacts as well. I hated this as I have thousands of contacts and I'm not sure how to weed them out now.  So check first to see if that's an option you can avoid.  OR, set up a new gmail or yahoo account first on your PC and then use that for your phone email, if anything to make it less messy.I hope you find this helpful.

A1KD07Z3Q7M4KG,B00FM7R1WG,Andy G,"[4, 4]","I wanted the cheapest possible smartphone plan for occasional use, and found Tracfone to be the way to go. I started with the 1200 minutes/texts/mb plan with a year of service so it won't expire too soon, and that was a good choice for me since I don't make calls often, and only use data for quick checks when I'm not on wifi.The phone is awful though. Google Maps crashes all the time and I can't use it. Browsing the web reminds me of the days of dialup, and it's purely because this phone can't handle it since I have very fast wifi at home. It works okay for calls, though when I switched, many people told me my call quality had dropped and they had a harder time hearing me. Both the cell signal and wifi signal are significantly reduced compared to other phones being used in the same place. I restart the phone before expecting to surf the web to at least start out fresh, but that just brings it from 'barely usable' to 'mediocre'.The camera is a piece of junk. Image quality is awful compared to any other phone I've used. The tint is always off, the images are grainy, and they never seem to focus well. Forget being able to snap a pic of something up close to research later, as any picture closer than 5ft has never came out in focus. This may be acceptable for instagram, but for anything else it's way sub-par.The only good thing about the phone is battery life. I mostly left it alone and once got 6 days on standby before it got to 10% battery. With my typical use, I get about 2 days. You really only get about 3 hours of heavy use, so if you are playing a game, surfing the web, responding to emails, etc. it will die pretty quickly, and this mostly seems to be due to having the screen on. I bought a spare battery for a few bucks which works great too, as a backup for traveling away from outlets.The trick I've found to making the most of Tracfone is to route your number through Google Voice. Since I take most of my calls at home by a computer anyway, I can just answer the calls on Google and not use any minutes. Texts sent via Google Voice are free also, but you pay for the ones received. Wifi is the key to limiting data use too, and I leave data off unless I am actively using it. This has meant that I can get by on about 2000 minutes per year which means I pay at most $200/yr for service.",2,"It was the best Tracfone at the time, that isn't saying much",1395878400,"03 27, 2014"

My wife had a Smartphone through work and when she didn't have that anymore it was getting harder to get her used to the non-smartphones again. I got her one and the complaints ended, so I decided to upgrade my old flip phone as well. Triple minutes for life is great and Tracfone actually not only triples your minutes it does an equal share across the board for text/data/talk. So there isn't any confusion on this, I'll demonstrate it for you... you buy minutes, say 400 minutes, right! So when you activate your 400 minute card you will receive 1200 minutes, that 400 X 3 = 1200. So now you'll have 1200 text minutes/ 1200 talk minutes and 1200 data minutes, from a 400 minute card. That's GREAT aint it!!!",5,True Android Tracfone... YEAH!!!!!,1392422400,"02 15, 2014"

A1KXJYQFHA5XMN,B00FM7R1WG,"Mike Crabtree ""Constitutional Guard Dog""","[13, 13]","While TF has 4 different Android models to chose from, the ZTE was the highest spec model that I saw.If you are looking for a hi end or mid grade Android phone dont stop here. ALL of the TF Androids are very entry level phones and as such be prepared for entry level performance.People look at the listed specs and note a 4 gig SD card but no mention of on board memory. Just for the record my phone after adding a few apps to it has 2.6 gigs of free space on the phone and well over 3 gigs on the 4 gig SD card that comes with the phone. With the size of the OS and what apps I installed I will speculate that the phone has 4 gigs on board and comes with the 4 gig SD. Not bad for a phone that is less than 100.00.When I first got it out of the box I put my GMail acct on it and started installing my apps. This bogged the phone down fast and for a short while I wondered if this was a bad phone, but remembering past situations even with tablets I just set the phone down and let it do its installs. After I was done installing apps I also downloaded the TF app that notifies you of available Call time, remaining text and available data, it also allows you to add time to your phone from the phone like any other TF, This app is very nice to have in the Google Play Store (GPS) since these Android phones do not have anything like it out of box.One person above posted that the Valet loses its connection to WiFI frequently and I have to agree, it seems to have a weak wifi antenna.While it would be great if this was better, it is not a game changer for me. My need for this phone is a way for my employer to reach me through the day. My boss gets on the phone, says what needs saying and is off. Little to no time wasted chatting. I suspect along with being very busy he is trying to save those platinum priced minutes that all cell phone companies charge for.A quick run down. It is a entry level phone so it has only 512 megs of ram, 1 gig processor and 4 gigs on board memory, touch screen is fairly responsive, it has a 3mp camera and flash on back and I don't remember the MP on the front. The back camera takes fair pictures. But only fair.Sound could be better, things are plenty clear but volumes could be louder. Again, entry level phone.In call....Everything seems to work just fine. In call volumes are fine, no echoes or reception problems, the phone is provided for by Verizon so if your in a good Verizon area you should be in good shape. But just keep in mind, if your current phone has bad reception in a given area this one probably will as well. My other work phone which I hope to replace with the Valet is a Straight Talk slider/android also covered by Verizon and the Valet has all the same drops that the other phone has. Seems Verizon just has few towers in some areas.Long story short, The ZTE Valet is a decent phone for the price. Remember it is a entry level phone at a entry level price and the phone is NOT loaded to the hilt with every bell and whistle. It does have Android 4.1 on it which is a plus and it does run fairly smoothly on a phone wit such low specs. This is a feather in ZTEs cap.One last note. My current monthly cell cost is 45.00+tax. And there was a LOT of that that was never used because it was strictly a work phone so it was used for 8 to 10 hours a day and then turned off for the evening and weekends.The Valet will allow me to cut the monthly price down to 20.00+ tax a month.I call that a win win. it will take 4 months for the phone to pay for itself and then it is pure savings after that, aprox 25.00 a month. and that is 300.00 a year I can use else ware.",4,"Finally, a Android on Tracfone :-)",1383177600,"10 31, 2013"
A2J6407B4TJFOW,B00FM7R1WG,"Mike Frerkes ""Mike""","[11, 12]","I was dying to get away from my contract plan (Galaxy Note 2 on US Cellular) and spotted this device in the store one day.  Never before did I imagine a functional Android phone could be maintained for as little as $7/month on a cellular network that is very reliable.  Yet, here it is...and I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to test the Android waters without spending a fortune.Let's be clear what this is not: A high-end phone with a data plan that allows you to stream audio and YouTube like it's going out of a style.  It is not a Samsung S4 with a snappy processor and hi-res camera.  If you're looking for that type of Android experience, you'll have to spend hundreds more -- even on a prepaid device.  What the Valet does do, however, is remarkable for its specific price point.The 1 GHz processor can run basic apps just fine.  Anything that is demanding (like games or HD video) will obviously challenge the Valet's hardware.  Just out of curiosity, I played Temple Run Oz since that game has fast-paced 3D graphics and relies heavily on accurate touch response and tilting.  To my surprise, the game was actually playable on the Valet.  The frame rate was sluggish in brief instances, and the overall display wasn't visually stunning, but the swipes and tilts registered quite effectively.  Considering this is a bare-bones mobile device, it was a bit surprising to see this game perform adequately.The Valet's battery life is typical for Android.  The call quality seemed passable, but the speaker volume is a little on the weak side.  Most of the specs on this phone are running average to below-average compared to other Android devices.  One pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a notification LED.  Even some mid-range phones lack this important feature, but the Valet does have it.  It also accepts MicroSD cards up to 32 GB, in case the 4 GB card (included) does not get the job done.I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of on-board storage.  Most entry-level prepaid devices don't have nearly enough internal storage capability.  The Valet boasts 4 GB internal, so you should have enough room for all your important apps and even a little extra space for non-essential ones.  Once again, for a sub-$100 Android device, you certainly can't find too many faults here.The biggest downside is the camera which is barely useful for anything but the simplest photos.  There is a flash, but no auto-focus.  The image quality might be okay for MMS messages.  However, anything beyond that purpose is going to be a disappointment.  This is not a huge deal-breaker for me personally since the phone does well in other areas.It is Tracfone's tremendous value which has made the Valet impressive to me.  Not everyone needs a high-end mobile device that costs over $100 per month to operate.  In fact, most people could get by with far less and not suffer any ill consequences.  This is the market segment that is all too often ignored by the big carriers.  If you're someone who has sat on the fence about getting a smartphone because of cost, the Valet has taken away your very last reservation.  Plans can run as little as $7 per month, depending on your usage patterns of course, and are extremely flexible for most basic-to-moderate cell phone users.  As an added bonus, the Valet is powered by Verizon's well-respected CDMA network meaning you won't have to worry much about &#34;dead zones&#34; and dropped calls.I couldn't give this phone a five-star rating due to some technical shortcomings, but it has earned a solid four-star review in my estimation.  Simply put, in a dollar-to-dollar comparison, the Valet on Tracfone gives you more than most every other prepaid offering out there right now.",4,Tremendous value for basic smartphone users,1386028800,"12 3, 2013"

I was  pleasantly surprised that Tracfone offered 3 phones for our area.  I narrowed it down to the Samsung Galaxy Centura and this ZTE phone.  After comparing specifications and reading a bunch of reviews I decided to go with the ZTE Valet and the family couldn't be happier.  I didn't purchase the phones here. I ended up getting them for $49.99 from Target and Best Buy.  We have only had the phones for 10 days, but no one has any complaints, so far.All the bad reviews relating to WIFI had me scared and was the biggest concern to not get this particular phone.  That fear has quickly gone away.  We get great reception through our Netgear router.  The reception is no better or worse than any of our other wireless products.  My biggest concern now is how long will the phone last.  Time will tell and I will adjust this review accordingly.Upgrading the phones through Tracfone was quick and easy.  Doing it online and following their directions was simple and pain free.

AGBQTQBTGOUV5,B00FM7R1WG,NutWrench,"[33, 33]","This is one of 2 Android phones offered by TracFone and one of the first Android phones I've seen where you don't have to buy a monthly contract (unlike Straight Talk). You add minutes by using cards or by buying them from TracFone's website. On this phone, when you add minutes, you will also get the same amount of data minutes in megs. For example, I have a triple-minutes-for-life phone, so when I add a 60 minute card for $19.99, I actually get 180 talk minutes, 180 text messages and 180 megabytes of data. Also, whenever you add minutes, you automatically get 3 months of service. All these minutes and messages and megs carry over to the next month. (My older Tracfone has a service end date sometime in 2016 from all the cumulative carry overs) :)Some basic specs:1 Ghz single-core ARM7 processorHas Android Jellybean (4.1)The MicroSD slot accepts expansion cards up to 32 gigabytesCamera has a flash.The phone has hardware GPS, even though it doesn't mention it in the specs.Separate camera button on the lower right of the phone (which means it will be upper-right when you rotate the phone to take pictures)This phone doesn't have the usual Tracfone custom firmware, typical of older Tracfones, with a pre-paid icon for managing your account and a constant ""minutes remaining"" on your Home Screen. You might not even think it was a pay-as-you-go phone at first glance because Tracfone has done a great job of staying out of the way of the phone's operating system and just handling the billing. Instead, Tracfone has an App on the Google Play store that you can use to check your balance and add minutes. The App also has a widget that you can place on an adjacent home screen if you want to do a quick check on your balance. Another nice thing is that if you have WiFi access, the phone will automatically use your WiFi connection for anything Internet-related instead of your precious data minutes. (Talk minutes still go over the phone network, unless you're using Skype or something)The phone works fine as an Android 4,1 Internet tablet right out of the box thanks to the built in WiFi. You'll get an ""activation needed"" message each time you start up the phone, but I was able to play around with it all day, setting up my Google Play account and trying out Apps until I got it home.

AO4DCU243V8AU,B00H2BJ7WC,Ben,"[2, 2]","I live in the Prepaid world. The last five phones I've bought have been Unlocked, for use with prepaid carriers. Basically, I decided to never sign a two-year agreement again, and I've been loving my live in the unlocked-realm ever since.Just seven months ago, I bought the Lumia 820 and found it (and the Windows Phone experience) to be 100% fun and fantastic - the best phone I've ever owned. I had seen many advertisements, videos and reviews on the flagship Lumia 1520, which I would loved to have had - but there is no way I'd fork out $500 on a phone.THEN, I learned of the Lumia 1320, which I call a &#34;poor man's Lumia 1520&#34; ... a Lumia 1520 for the rest of us. A fantastic, 6-inch Tablet / Phone that is fast, responsive, beautiful and of Quality build. It performs beautifully and looks every bit as good. It feels good in the hand.All of this for less than $300 unlocked, just a little more than I paid for my Lumia 820 (which I have also reviewed here). You'll hear some criticism from tech &#34;critics&#34; out on the web, complaints about the pixel density, camera, etc. Don't worry about it and don't take any of those &#34;reviewers&#34; too seriously. The relative PPI is more than adequately made up and compensated for in the fundamentals of the quality and the Clear Black IPS LCD Display. In short, things look great, photos look great, videos look great.Internal Storage is 8GB, leaving about 4-5 Gigs for your use. There is a slot for Micro SD card and the Windows OS settings allows you to designate all storage, downloads, saved photos, videos and music to the card ... AND Apps; I've loaded mine up with a 32 Gig card, which should keep me fat and comfy for awhile.Interchangeable Back Plates - you can buy and swap out back plates of various colors for your Lumia 1320, giving yourself a whole &#34;new&#34; phone to suit your mood. Once slapped on, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate that is permanently affixed. I bought this as a white phone, have bought back battery covers in Yellow, Black, Orange and Green. This is one of the features of the Lumia 820 that I really enjoyed, nice to have it here as well. As a side note, the back cover is much easier to remove on the 1320.Battery Life is VERY good. I don't know how they do it, but Nokia has managed to created a Tablet Phone with robust life and lower battery drain. I'm comparing this to my Lumia 820 (which was good) and my Blu Vivo 4.8 HD (android) phone. I'm getting plenty of talk time and long periods of standby time on this, a benefit I was not expecting.Camera. In order to put all this together at what is essentially a third-world price, you have to cut some corners somewhere. That is where we find the biggest difference between the 1320 and it's flagship big brother, the 1520. You've got a 5MP camera, which for me, is also a step-down from my Lumia 820. Guess what? I don't care. At 5MP, you still have sharp optics, a quarter-inch sensor and Fast Glass - a 2.4 aperture lens, which gathers much light, fast enough to garner nice results in dimly-lit places. An LED flash rounds it out, and if you really need to rag on the fact this phone's camera has less than 10, 20 or 40MP ... go buy a cheap point-and-shoot camera and carry that in your other pocket.Gorilla Glass 3 - Huge bonus and nice surprise to have a budget Tablet Phone with such sturdy, state-of-the-art elements. This is not something I expected to find at a piece of kit for under $300 dollars, and especially not at this size!Main Video Camera shoots at 1080p, Full HD (1920 X 1080) at 30 frames per second. Again, something you would not expect at this price. I have shot and viewed videos on my (60-inch) TV, and loving the results.I've upgraded this to Windows 8.1, as I did with my Lumia 820. Both phones have taken the upgrade flawlessly. If you want more technical details, check out some of the many sites on the web, and I encourage you to view some of the youtube videos as well. You'll get more detailed tech talk and a good idea as to what it looks (and feels like) in the hand. Just remember to take those &#34;critics&#34; with a grain of salt. For my part ... as a real-life owner and verified buyer of the Lumia 1320, I'm telling you this Tablet Phone is fan-TASTIC.If you've ever dreamed of owning the Lumia 1520 but can't afford it (or have more sense than to spend $500 for a phone device) ... or if you'd just like a Tablet Phone that is good, solid and FUN to operate ... or if you're in any way on the fence about this, jump off that fence and buy one of these now! Seriously, you can't lose and you won't regret....",5,"Great Phone, Excellent Value and FUN to Own!",1403654400,"06 25, 2014"

I previously used the Samsung Ativ S for about a year and though it was nice enough Unwanted something newer, bigger and with wireless charging. The 1520 offered everything I loved about my previous device (sans Samsung apps, which were no major loss) plus all of the Nokia apps, more solid build, faster updates (my Ativ S never received the latest update, which was a supposedly made available months ago). Plenty of others have already praised the specs and performance of the device, 1080p resolution 6&#34; display, amazing battery that routinely lasts 35-40 hours of moderate use, fast processor, 32GB of storage plus up to 64 more via micro SD, the device has LTE, but this version is compatible with bands used outside of the United States so I only get HSPA+, which is fast enough since I'm usually using WiFi.

Deploying windows phone 8.1 provides more functionality not available in windows phone 8 and more reliable phone (Still for Developers). Microsoft and Nokia have to work better and push developers and companies to create and develop apps for Windows phone OS. Compared to iOS(Apple) and Android(Google) there are limitation to apps - yet understandable in-terms of market maturity. I enjoy the offline maps where I have all North America downloaded for free thus providing free offline GPS. Coming from iOS and Android, you will feel the difference mainly in the lack of apps thus making the phone less usable if you are a gamer or just download apps for fun. Keep in mind, if you integrate you email (outlook or corporate email), Microsoft Office, XBOX, etc.. you can have one unified ecosystem - that's what I love about Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1.

A2TVI1H36ZUB7,B00H2BJ7WC,Glen A. Urbina Cespedes,"[4, 4]","HARDWAREAesthetically this phone is BEAUTIFUL, a master piece! I like minimalist and simple things. I love the 1520 design, everything is placed where it should. Buttons are placed nicely!! The camera button comes very handy!The back camera? Amazing, wonderful! As a photo enthusiast I can say the camera is one of the best phone cameras I have seen with many advanced features! And the camera button comes really handy! The flash sucks. It should have been xenon.Front camera? Still needs some work, for my taste it sucks pretty badly. Grainy and slow if dark! Bad, bad, bad resolution.Sensors are precise and work perfectly, I always turned them off in my S3, S4, Note, HTC's, Moto's because they were random and not precise... they made me rage more than once. Only thing missing is an IR blaster, that would be really useful! And maybe fingerprint scanner ONLY if it works as it should, I think that technology is not ready yet for prime time.Also about Qi charging, once you go for it there's no way back! I even put a DT 900 hidden on my desk and nightstand, charges fast and it is so convenient!Processor? Powerful. You can throw anything at it! If you updated to WP 8.1 DP... It is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW so it will lag a little sometimes and some things won't work as intended, you will have to make a soft reset-restart and hopefully it will resolve your issue or you will have to wait for the official release.The battery in this thing is amazing, I'd never have thought that it would last forever with the screen size but it does! Using Xbox music to stream music all day! Whatsapp, FB and web browsing all day, by 10 PM is still around 15-20%. ~5 hours of listening to music with a Sony Bluetooth SBH20, 4-5 hours of screen time while using Whatsapp, FB, web browsing, skipping songs. Gaming, once in a while.It has micro SD slot, YES! No micro SD slot is a deal killer for me!SIM tray is loose! BAD!Touch screen sensitivity is good, perfect! And I have no more issues with it!Signal is good but it will chose slowest networks (EDGE, 3G, HSDPA+) if they are stronger than the fastest ones. And you CAN'T force it to HSDPA or LTE.Screen is gorgeous, crisp, clear, stunning! But there's a defect with most lumias, in white backgrounds you will see brighter spots in a specific part of the screen exactly where the back camera is placed. Other than that is perfect for me! Anyway you won't notice the bright spot!Glance feature is wonderful! I think it is not supported by 930 and some others phones because of the screen technology used.VERY IMPORTANT. Screen seems to be fragile, still haven't drop it! Case or insurance could save your life, screen replacement is expen$ive. I have seen many post talking about broken digitizers and screens. Replacing only the digitizer is NOT easy at all if you manage to replace it without breaking the screen, that if you are lucky enough and didn't break the screen.SOFTWAREI've had about everything but iPhone, I do love my 1520 but as a power user WP 8.1 is still lacking advanced features/options. About the apps, I have the ones I need but they are lacking advanced options/features because of WP limitations and some others because apparently programmers aren't putting much effort in WP apps. But with WP 8.1 they finally added so much stuff that was missing and with WP 8.1 Microsoft is finally giving more freedom for making apps with everything we need but still not as much as Android.For most people 8.1 will do! I am a power user, but most people are not! They have everything they need in 8.1 (just a few things missing, maybe some advanced options would be nice) BUT the 1520 is BLAZING FAST! Butter smooth! Not like my any other phone I've had!Size of everything is about perfect on a 1520! The keyboard and the new swipe thing is amazing! Cortana is nice, and we have music recognition integrated (I'd suggest MS to improve it, is slow sometimes and if you don't have internet connection you are done. Some apps in Android store the recording so you can search that song later, you can't do that with Bing)! Also integrated translation and QR scan, pretty sweet to translate things just with the camera.Now WP and Lumia has some unique features and apps that I love so much and are freaking good: IE sucks on Windows but on WP is way too good, beats any other browser! Nokia apps are awesome, beamer, maps, camera, etc.!The integration with Microsoft services is good, you will love it! It integrates with many services very nicely!For music lovers, Xbox music pass is the way to go! Better than Pandora, Spotify, etc.! Music player is kind of mediocre but it will do. Gallery is GOOD! Better than android!Clean and simple OS, very good looking! I'd only add a few more advanced options and more transparent tiles for this new image backgrounds! And a color palette to choose our own accent and background colors, that would be sweet!OVERALLHardware is good and this thing is damn pretty! Problems? Loose SIM tray, bright spots on the screen (you won't notice unless someone told you so), front camera sucks, FRAGILE screen. No IR blaster, no fingerprint yet. Battery, screen, processor, sensors, etc are amazing! Micro SD slot up to 128GB!Software? You get everything you need, still missing some advanced features! But 8.1 is getting close to iOS and Android. Still has some advantages and unique design and features, and it is BUTTER SMOOTH. Integrates very nicely with MS services and some others. You have to try it to know what I'm talking about, but Microsoft is doing a good damn job with 8.1.I think a 30-40% fanboys will betray Apple and Samsung if they had this thing for a day. Throw an IR blaster, fingerprint scanner and everyone most of them will be sold, you don't even need some advanced options in apps or OS level. Keep it going Microsoft!Did I miss something? Any questions, doubts? Ask!",5,Nice work Nokia!,1400025600,"05 14, 2014"
A2P6WKFYV8A3PC,B00H2BJ7WC,"joe ""Joe""","[29, 30]","Nokia built an amazing phone with customized applications and Windows Phone 8 performs flawlessly. Super fast processor, smooth video; you can finally watch a video and listen to it with Bluetooth headphones (mine is Plantronics backbeat 903+).For those skeptical regarding applications, there is Instagram and Whatsapp for W8 (download is free for both) and many more free apps, although Lumia 1520 brings a load of essential applications.Very advisable to buy a cover, not only for its protection but for a better handling. I found the device extremely slippery in my hands. I purchased a cover with kick stand, so I can eat and read or watch a video.W8 automatically backs up most your data (pics, docs and videos) to skydrive, which is very convenient. All contacts I had on my HTC HD7 (Windows phone 7.5) was imported as soon as I register my accounts (Hotmail, Facebook and Google) even without the sim card. A great feature is that you can access your Lumia 1520 from your PC as if it is an external hard drive. You can also receive and send several kinds of files via Bluetooth. The NFC (Near Field Communication)  is amazing!!I still donnot understand people who rather pay a lot more for an IPhone or Android!!I also purchased a 32Gb micro SD (you can install up to 64Gb), which is another feature Iphones don't have.Also amazing is the battery. You will now have a phone that will keep up with you all day, provided you make a normal use of it. Remember to charge it, use it until battery runs out and charge it again, so that your battery will be optimized.Only disappointment regards to the charger which is European. Although seller sends (at no cost) an American adapter, it gets to be a very clumsy piece (both together).Well done Microsoft and Nokia.February 6th UpdateToday I test the Here Nokia (the built in GPS) I turned it on together with my car's GPS, except that I made it work offline.

A3AYSYSLHU26U9,B00H4WNRZ2,Amazon Deity,"[5, 7]","When I first turned this little thing on it played 2 notes to let you know it is working. That was the first indication this was not a normal little speaker. The sound just vibrated my hand and sounded like a much larger speaker. After putting it on the table it made a few more sounds and went right into the pairing mode and my phone connected right to it.Of course the first thing I did was find a song and crank it up until the family yells,""Turn that thing down!"" two rooms away. Nice! Since it is made for phones and has a mic in it as well, I then called my unsuspecting spouse who said it sounded fine on the other end, but on my end it sounded great. Nice full bass tones and much preferred over the phone's speaker phone.The practical side of me then kicked as I thought what I would really use it for. If I had to do a long conference call I would use the MOSOUND in a heart beat. The sound would be very easy on the ears and would free me up to do other things, like shop Amazon, during those long pointless calls we all get sucked into. I think it would easily pick up my, ""uh huh"" and ""yes, of course I am listening.""We connected both a Galaxy 3 and my iPhone to it with no problem.On a day to day basis though it will not see much phone time. I have better plans. Anyone with an iPad knows the speakers are less than amazing, pretty much useless.  To hear anything in a noisy environment you either need to use head phones, which mess my hair, ear buds that just bother me or cup your hand just right under the speaker to shoots the sound forward. The MOOUND has transformed my iPad to a great multimedia machine with out having to do any of the fore mentioned. I like laying in on a table next to me so it is aimed at my ear and I get great sound while no one else really hears much.In the car, it fits nicely in the cup holder that actually boosts the bass nicely and I don't have to mess around plugging the phone into the car radio.Comparing it to other wireless speakers I have to say price and size-wise it is a great deal. I do have a larger and much more expensive unit that sounds a bit better and louder, but it is not as practical for carrying around.

In fact the sound of this tiny speaker is better than I expected for such a very small speaker!On this speaker, there is no volume control, I adjusted the volume from my phone, player or tablet and it worked fine! The loudness that this speaker achieved is exceptional for a such a small personal speaker.+ Phone Reception - When I had my phone paired and I was listening to music, then my phone rang through the speakers, I was able to use this as a hands free speaker. Very clear reception.+ Portability &#8211; Because this unit is so compact, I placed it in a zip lock sandwich bag and easily fit it into my purse along with my phone, and now I can play my tunes anywhere!This unit (in white) was given to me as a test unit and I agreed to test it and give it my honest and fair review.

A37MH7ICH80QOX,B00H4WNRZ2,Kate McMurry,"[12, 14]","When I received this mini speaker, I immediately began comparing its features and functionality with my brand newXBOOM Mini Portable Capsule Speaker. Here is what I found:1) Sound: For playing music, the Mocreo is slightly more resonant. Speech sounds the same.2) Size and attractiveness: The Mocreo is slightly bigger than the XBOOM, and the XBOOM can fold inward and becomes about half the size of the Mocreo.3) Device compatibility: The XBOOM can be used with many different devices, including my Sansa Clip MP3 player. The Mocreo doesn't work with my Sansa.4) Volume Control: The XBOOM has its own volume control, but the Mocreo does not.5) On/Off Button: The Mocreo has a much better on/off button than the XBOOM. It is a toggle switch on the bottom of the Mocreo, which I can find by feel. In contrast, the XBOOM has a switch that is small and has to be flicked sideways to turn it on, and every single time I want to turn it on, I have to visually search for the button.6) Charging: The XBOOM comes with a charger I can plug into the wall, and its cable is several feet long. The Mocreo only includes a micro USB cable for charging the speaker via connection to a computer, so to wall charge it, I have to provide my ownwall charger.7) Wireless: The Mocreo's biggest claim to fame is that it is wireless. When I hook the XBOOM to my iPhone to play music, it is difficult to pick up the phone to fiddle with other apps because the XBOOM's cable is only about four inches long. There is no such problem with this device since there is no cable at all. However, there is no lag time at all from the moment I hook the XBOOM to my iPhone and the sound coming out of that speaker. In contrast, the Mocreo takes about 15-20 seconds to kick in after I turn it on and start playing music on my iPhone.8) Microphone: The Mocreo includes a microphone and the XBOOM does not. I personally find the Mocreo's microphone to be a big problem. The only reason that I can see that it exists is for hookup to a smart phone to do speakerphone calls. The problem is this: In my testing of it for that purpose, it produces a muffled sound. It is not entirely impossible to understand, but it is much more difficult than the sound produced by my iPhone's own microphone--which does not function as long as the phone is hooked to the Mocreo. When I hook up the XBOOM to my iPhone for a speakerphone call, it gives me the advantage of being able to hear my caller's voice more loudly, and the sound coming to them from my end is the same quality whether I have the XBOOM turned on or not, because either way the microphone in my iPhone is what is being used.All in all, I would say that the Mocreo is slightly better for playing music off my iPhone than the XBOOM, and I will probably use it for that. I prefer the XBOOM for speakerphone calls, and I will have to continue to use the XBOOM for listening to audiobooks on my Sansa Clip, because the Mocreo isn't compatible with it.Reviewer disclosure: I received one of these speakers from the merchant who sells it here on Amazon in order to test it out before writing an impartial review.",5,Works well,1389225600,"01 09, 2014"

I've streamed music, talk radio and taken calls with it and it has performed well each and every time.

Sitting about 2-inches high as almost as wide, this works as both a music speaker and a conference call/phone speaker.  The button on the bottom turns it on and pairs it.  It paired with my iPhone within seconds with a nice blue/red flashing light and a deep two-toned beeping sound.  It fully charges in less than 2 hours and contains a charging cord with USB and micro USB end pieces.A little blue LED light brightly announces that it is on.  The sound is very clear on the highs are very good on the midranges, but the bass is slight.  The speaker is 1.5-inches and the battery is 350mAh which is about the power of charging your smartphone about 10%-15%.  It certainly does not contain that boomy, thunderous bass, if that is what you are looking for.However, I see this as a perfect, carry-able speaker/phone for talking or having a conference call.  The voice quality is perfect and for the price-you cannot beat this.  The fully powered speaker will last up to six hours of talk time, so having it in your office when the typical conference call dinosaur device doesn't work will save your meeting.

This speaker takes about 2-1/2 hours to charge when the battery is empty to a full charge. I used a wall USB adapter to charge it but it could also be plugged into the USB adapter on a computer. There is a little red light on it that turns blue to tell you it's charged. A micro cable to USB cable is included with the speaker. This speaker paired almost instantly with my iPhone and I later tried it with an iTouch and a Kindle HD and they also paired without any problem.I was very surprised at how good this sounded for it's small size and price. I tested this with classical music first because the range of tones from all the different instruments is always a good way to hear the capabilities of a speaker. I could tell it was a small speaker but the notes were crisp and clear and the range was decent. It sounded better than my laptop speakers so it's a good way to listen to music while working on the laptop. It's very good when used as a speaker phone and it's small enough to bring along in the car. You can lay it on it's side to direct the sound when using it for that. One side has a slight flat indentation to keep it from rolling around. I was able to move about 30 feet from the source before the sound started to cut out which is pretty much typical for Bluetooth devices.I received the white model which is quite attractive and it has a nice quality look and feel to it. I think the only thing that's lacking is a wired connection, it's Bluetooth only. That isn't particularly important to me sine I seldom use this type of speaker as anything other than a Bluetooth device but it might be important to some people.

A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00H4WNRZ2,Stephen M. Lerch,"[2, 3]","For a quick review, if you are looking to add a BT speaker to your phone (I paired it w/ a Lumia 1020 and iPhone 5S), the sound from this little, light, easy to carry speaker is pretty spectacular.The one limitation I find slightly annoying, and part of the reason for a drop from 5 stars to 4.5/4.75 (still ranked it as 5), is that you can't control volume from the speaker itself - not a huge deal since I just carry my phone anyway. You can control the previous/next track capability from the speaker though, and using it as a speaker phone worked really well also.If you plan to connect this to your Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 computer, I would recommend against it. The sound is anemic for some reason with no apparent way to correct it, other than using software with an equalizer, and even then for some reason it never sounds as good as just pairing to a phone. Very odd.My longer review:Pairing the device is bang on simple. The first time you power it on, it is in pairing mode. Set your device to pair and it should locate and connect to it. If you have already paired the device, simply power the speaker off if it isn't already, then press and hold the power button for a few seconds until the blue light on the speaker flashes red/blue indicating it is in pairing mode.The sound quality, for the size and price, is phenomenal. An audiophile will never be satisfied with this speaker, but as an audiophile that can allow for and cope with the limitations of portable audio, this is actually one of the best sounding mini-BT speakers I've had the pleasure to use. As long as it is paired to a phone and not a Windows PC.I tried an amalgamation of music, from Death Metal, Thrash Metal, Japanese Pop, Rock, Pop and classical to test. Classical music, with the subtle nuances involved in the performances, suffers a little but still sounds acceptable. I've driven the speaker to the maximum volume of my Lumia and while it gets to a point of sounding a bit harsh, it never pops or makes other odd noises. Overall the volume is fairly loud, but not ear bleed level.Overall, this is a nice speaker that would be easy to carry and sounds great. Don't get it for sound from a Windows PC (I'll keep kicking it around to try to figure it out), but for a phone or other non-Windows device, it should sound really good and do well for you.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.",5,"Depending on how you use it, sounds great and easy to setup",1388880000,"01 05, 2014"

This doesn&#8217;t always result in the best sound quality, but by simply turning the unit on its side, you can position the speaker to get better results.

By messing with the top part of the case, I mean if it isn't fully sealed (which it feels like it will stretch over time) it will allow water to go through.I left it in the bowl for 5 minutes untouched and fully sealed and it did not allow one drop of water in.  However, once I happen to just flick the top of the case, water drops started to enter visibly on the interior screen case in less than a minute and in 5 minutes I had a small pool of water inside.  I think if they had a way to ensure  that the top did not flick open so easily it would have been perfect.

AX05DBU8IRUWY,B00HZX8RTG,C. Schmidt,"[5, 8]","*Disclosure: I was contacted by a representative for Ultraproof and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it.*First and foremost, the warranty.  Ok, I admit that maybe it's just me, but, if a company claims their product will protect your device against almost anything, within certain limits, then I expect that claim to be backed up with a solid device replacement warranty should the product fail.  Ultraproof isn't that confident in their product, offering only a warranty on the case not falling apart on you.  To be fair, neither Otterbox nor Lifecase offer this type of protection either.  Bottom line: If the product fails and your phone is done in, a replacement comes out of your pocket.Ultraproof is very upfront about the buyer testing this case prior to putting their phone in it.  Fair enough, and that is what I did.  According to the specs, it should be able to go to 8' of water for 30 minutes without a problem.  The suggested testing is detailed as being put it in 6"" of water for 5 minutes.  My first test was to simply submerge the case fully, lengthwise, in a large cup of water.  An hour later, and no moisture inside.  My second test was to add turbulence to the water.  That one didn't go so well.  The cover on the headset port popped loose, letting water in.  My third test was to simulate what would happen if the phone were really dropped into a pool or something after sitting out in the sun. More or less, temperature shock, going from hot to cold over a short period of time.  Using an already dead iPhone (none of my friends would loan me theirs for some reason), I let the case sit out in the sun for an hour, then dropped in into a basin of water.  In this test, again, the port cover popped open.  For my final test, I put the case in the dishwasher, on the upper rack, and ran the washer through a cycle.  Other than my first test, this is the only one when neither port cover came off.  Looking at the manual further, I noted that Ultraproof states in the ""Warnings"" section that you need to keep the case out of the sunlight to prevent heat buildup.  They also warn you not to drop it, which for a case that is also ShockPROOF, that seems odd.Having satisfied my curiosity on how well the case really held up to water, I moved on to testing it out as a daily use case.  All the buttons worked fine, the screen sensitive to touch, and pictures taken from the camera were clear.  Making calls with it and listing to music wasn't great.  I got complaints that I couldn't be understood, and the feeling was mutual.  Music was muffled and distorted.  Dropping the unit from various heights and onto different surfaces, with previously mentioned dead iPhone inside, the case held together just fine.  Again my friends refused to loan my their phones to try the case with a live one, so I'm unable to give credit to the case being ShockPROOF.  For my final test, I decided to see about that SandPROOF business was about.  Tossing the case in a sandblasting box, I hit it with some grit.  No sand got inside, and other than marring the clear plastics, the case was intact.After all of this, I would hesitate purchasing this.  Especially if what one wants to do is take the phone into the pool with them for some underwater photography.  The case is great for keeping water off your phone is it's just a splash or fall in the sink, true.  But as an every day use case, I think it's really lacking.  If you consistently use a Bluetooth or wired headset for making calls, and either a wired or Bluetooth speaker for listening to tunes, then you can toss out the problems I came across concerning quality of those functions.  The person I gave my sample to plans to use it in this way, and I hope they enjoy it.",3,"Everything-PROOF, eh?",1394928000,"03 16, 2014"

The flexible rubber and plastic sides and back are advertised as ""shock absorbing"" and they appear to offer more protection than the usual plastic iPhone covers that I have tested. It is advertised as ""Shockproof, Snowproof, Dirtproof, and ""Waterproof"" to 8 feet for up to 30 minutes. The touch screen and all button controls were fully accessible through the case; an Ultraproof rotating switch, above the speaker buttons on the side, moves the manual ""ringer/silent"" flip switch back and forth with no problem. The IPhone5S fingerprint 'touch button' is not accessible, but the button's ""Push"" function is normal.After carefully following the instructions (close all ports tightly, seal the two pieces going from bottom to top, push in hard on the seals from all sides and at top and bottom) and testing the 'waterproof capability' of the case at sea level, without an iPhone inside, the results are: Test 1 through 4: underwater for 30 minutes-completely dry. But when another test ran 8 hours: the case had moisture bubbles on the main clear plastic screen and a small amount of moisture inside; testing underwater for 1 hour: a few drops of water breached the case. So the conclusion is that this particular case is ""water proof"" for the manufacturer's stated time period, but beyond that it is ""water resistant"", so be mindful of the time factor when it is in the water. NO depth testing to 8 feet was performed. All tests were without an iPhone mounted in the case. Highly Recommended with limitations noted. Four and a half ACCEPTABLE Stars.

I applied the i-Blason screen protector with little issues. The only one I had was that the included tape was worthless. I had some lint get in between the phone and the screen protector when I was applying it and the included tape was not ""sticky"" enough to remove it. I was annoyed because I had the screen protector in one hand and the included tape wrapped around my finger in the other hand and I did not want to let go of the screen protector because then it would ""seal"". If you've ever ""unsealed"" these types of screen protectors, then you know that you can ""pinch"" a corner trying to lift it off again causing a slight annoying bend on the edge that will not completely flatten out when you go to re-apply it. Luckily this was not the case with I-Blason screen protector and I was able to lift the screen protector up again without causing a bend at the edge of the screen protector.  I ended up using some plain ol' scotch tape and that did the trick.Once the screen protector was on, it was so clear that not even the Verizon employee noticed it was on when I went to get my phone activated. He tried selling me one, and I told him it already had one on. The Verizon employee had to hold the phone at an angle to see it, as if he was a cop checking an ID for authenticity.

Regardless I still put a magnetic clasp and I can tell it will rip the case material if i fool with it too much.I don't like the screen view. although it's a neat trick but has very limited functionality but it's neat..I absolutely hate that it's a cheap plastic screen, fingerprints, hair and everything gets trapped. I hope can find or make a coated screen to cover it.I would of kept the wallet version if they had one that charged but had to return that to get this one. I now can 'enjoy' taking square pictures without opening the screen and see the time and weather.. this really expensive option is the only option if you want to maintain with assurance that the water resistance is maintained and keeping the overall size of the phone as small as possible. if you can deal with a little bigger case and 'floppier' designs go for it, but this is a high end option for a 2014 phone.I agree that this won't really protect the corners of your phone.

It looks nice, Doesn't make the phone much thicker and protects the screen for the most part while in the pocket.However...  When the phone is sitting on it's back the front doesn't stay closed.  It constantly opens up just enough to wake the phone up and have it go to sleep over and over.  This drains the battery on the phone as the screen is constantly turning on/off thinking the cover is being opened and closed.  It's just on the edge of detecting the magnet above it.  Place the phone face down anytime you set it on a table and you are fine.  The wireless charging works great with the black lugulake chargers.  The white one gets the job done but I have found it charges slower than on the more powerful lugulake chargers with built in batteries.My last complaint.  It doesn't protect the sides and corners of the phone.  If the phone is dropped on a corner it will still probably break the glass.  Also make sure that there are no particulates such as sand or dirt in your picket or under the screen as this case will grind the single piece of sand or dirt into the screen leaving a small mark which happened with mine within the first couple of days I had it.  Also using the already difficult to use finger print reader is now even more anoying as you have to use two hands to now hold the top open while you swipe your finger.

This model is one of the most portable units I have, which means that while convenient, it is far more likely to &#34;wander off&#34;.=== The Good Stuff ===* The unit is a nice size, 2 5/8&#34; x 2 1/8&#34; x 1 1/16&#34;, and weighs 3.2 ounces. The plastic is nicely finished and rounded, has a fingerprint resistant matte finish, and has one small blue LED to indicate charging in progress. The unit is rated for 120-240V 50/60Hz, so it should travel well. The AC plug folds back into the unit, so it is easy to carry in a shirt pocket. It comes with a nicely worded and complete set of instructions, although I doubt anyone will ever read them.* There are two USB ports, a Universal port rated at 1.5A, and a Superport rated at 2.4A. Both ports were able to charge my iPhone and iPad, although the charging time for the iPad on the 1.5A port was slower than usual. Charging times for the iPhone on either port, and the iPad on the Superport seems about the same as the Apple supplied chargers. The unit was able to charge both simultaneously, but I did not note the charging time.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* Nothing really. I always worry about fold-up power plugs, they are usually the first things to fail. But to be honest, I usually lose these things before they wear out, so I am not too worried.=== Summary ===A nice little 2 port charger that was able to charge my most used devices.

The prongs click into the closed position (and stay in place nicely), but I can pull open the prongs with a one finger action.This charger looks very similar to one other on the market now, I noticed it while browsing through this product page.  That other one may have more reviews at the moment I'm writing this, but THIS ONE PROVIDES MORE POWER.  This one has a 2.4A plus a 1.5A.  (The other one only provides 1.0A for the bottom slot.)  So, choose wisely and read all the print.The manufacturer claims that this charger will protect against over-heating, too much current and over-charging, and that charging will automatically stop when the battery is full.  Words like that--although only words--somehow give me confidence that this charger will not harm my phone or my tablet.*I received a sample product from Orico.",5,Basic 2.4 + 1.5 wall charger that works just fine!,1399507200,"05 08, 2014"
AUEY946M1L939,B00J8JWNUE,"John L Murphy ""Fionnch""","[1, 1]","The make of this follows the standard design. The US prong folds up, the size is small, and the design straightforward. It's always good to have a LED light, and the blue color is unobtrusive while visible at a distance. One port is a Super Charger mode (S for I assume Samsung) and the other is a Universal one.The instructions indicate that the Super Charger mode shuts off after the device is charged, so I wanted to try this for my devices. I used my smartphone, at 4%, and tested it with the Orico DCX-2U dual-port AC Wall charger. (I received this to test.) It charged, but no quicker than when I have used a similar plug-in charger at the standard 1.0 port instead of the presumably 2.1 one here.",3,Meets standards but may not exceed them,1399334400,"05 06, 2014"
AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00J8JWNUE,NF,"[3, 3]","There isn't a lot to say about the Orico wall charger as it's a simple device that plugs into a wall and has two USB ports for charging two devices at the same time. The two ports have different output capacities, so you'll need to pay attention to which you plug your device into. The Super Charger port has a 2.4A capacity for charging a high-capacity device like a tablet and the Universal port has a 1.5A capacity for charging a lower-capacity device like a typical SmartPhone. The ports are clearly labeled, so there's no chance of confusion.You can definitely charge a tablet on either port; it's just that it will take less time on the Super Charger port. You can also charge a SmartPhone on either port but you won't see much advantage to using the Super Charger port as the phone won't be able to take advantage of the higher capacity.The plug folds into the charger to make it easier to carry. The charger has a low-light blue LED to indicate that it's charging a device and it has circuitry to automatically stop charging when your device has reached its capacity. That last feature is pretty important as it's not good for the battery to stay plugged in after it's reached 100%.Note that the charger does not come with a cable; you're on your own for the cable between your device and the charger. Given the proliferation of cables that I have from all of the devices I've owned, this really isn't a problem for me.The bottom line is that this is a compact charger with some nice features at a competitive price. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome. I have no personal or financial interest in the company or in anyone employed there.",5,"Solid, sturdy, and a competitive price",1399420800,"05 07, 2014"

As to whether the super charger charges my devices any faster than any other charger, the jury is still out. If this charger works 30 seconds faster than the next seems like a silly comparison to me. In shopping for any wall charger I&#8217;d want to know that it does what is was designed to do, and it works efficiently and effectively over the course of its life. In other words, instant speed measurements mean nothing with a device like the Orico. The true test will be in how long it remains reliable. Right now the Orico appears to be the perfect little super charger &#8211; small and lightweight enough to travel well, and powerful enough to charge my iPhone while I wait for my car to be serviced.
